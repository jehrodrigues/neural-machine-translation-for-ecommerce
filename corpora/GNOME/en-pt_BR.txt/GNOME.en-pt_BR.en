Accerciser
Introduction
Accerciser is an interactive Python accessibility explorer for the GNOME desktop. It uses AT-SPI to inspect and control widgets, allowing you to check if an application is providing correct information to assistive technologies and automated test frameworks. Accerciser has a simple plugin framework which you can use to create custom views of accessibility information.
In essence, Accerciser is a next generation at-poke tool.
Getting Started
To Start Accerciser
You can start Accerciser in the following ways:
Applications menu
Choose the ProgrammingAccerciser menu item.
Command line
Type the following command in a console window then press Return:
accerciser
When You Start Accerciser
When you start Accerciser, the following window is displayed.
Accerciser Main Window
Shows main window. Contains title bar, menu bar, accessible tree , right plugin display area, and bottom plugin display area. The menu bar contains File, Edit, Bookmarks, View, and Help menus.
The main Accerciser window contains the following elements:
Menubar
The menu bar contains commands for managing plugins, managing and using bookmarks, refreshing the accessible tree view, and accessing this help system.
Accessible tree view
The accessible tree view allows to view all of the accessibles starting at the desktop level. Selecting an accessible makes it available for further inspection using the loaded plugins.
Right plugin view
This is one of the two default plugin views. When Accerciser is first run, most plugins will reside here. You can drag plugin tabs to the bottom plugin view or to the desktop to show two or more plugins simultaneously.
Bottom plugin view
You can drag plugins to or from this area just like the right plugin view.
Plugin View Management
Accerciser has two modes for viewing plugins. The current view mode could be toggled with ViewSingle plugin view or by pressing Controlt. When single mode is enabled, all plugins will be put in the top right plugin view and ordered alphabetically, this could be useful for screen reader users who have no use for Accerciser's flexible plugin spacial layout scheme. When single view mode is disabled plugin tabs could be dragged and dropped in to different plugin views, or could be dragged to the desktop to put the given plugin in a new view. The placement of plugins could also be manipulated with the plugin context menu that could be brought up either from the plugin tab, or the plugin preferences dialog.
Usage
You can use Accerciser to inspect any accessible widget shown in the tree view using the available plugins. The first step is to select an accessible to inspect using one of the following methods:
Select an accessible through the tree view.
Use the tree view to navigate the hierarchy of accessible objects rooted at desktop. Unfolding a tree node reveals its immediate children while folding it hides them. Each node shows an icon for its associated application or widget role and its accessible name, if available. The second column lists how many nodes will be shown if the item is unfolded.
Using bookmarks
Accerciser allows bookmarking selected accessibles for later examining. This could be helpful if the target application must be restarted, for example after rebuilding it. To bookmark the currently selected accessible do BookmarksAdd Bookmark... or press Controld.
Bookmarks to accessibles in Accerciser are defined by an application name and a "path" in the application's internal accessible hierarchy to the bookmarked accessible. When the target application is in a different state (ie. multiple top level frames) the path might not be correct.
Bookmarks could be managed by accessing the bookmark editing dialog through BookmarksEdit Bookmarks....
Default Plugins
Accerciser comes with several default plugins. These plugins allow you to view a variety of information about the currently selected accessible in the tree view and its neighbors. The default plugins available in 0.1.5 are the following:
Interface Viewer
This plugin displays information about the available interfaces for the selected tree view accessible. Unsupported interfaces are grayed out. Various instruments for viewing and controlling an interface are available under each expander.
Interfaces that are supported by the selected accessible are shown as sensitive.
Event Monitor
This plugin monitors the selected types of events from the selected tree view accessible, from the selected tree view application, or the entire desktop.
The bottom part of the event monitor window allows you to pick the type and source of events.
By pressing ControlAltl anywhere on the desktop, the last logged event will be highlighted for later reference. See for how to change this key combination.
IPython Console
This plugin is a fully-fledged IPython console. Press Tab to show completions for the current command. Press Enter to execute any valid Python code. Commands at the console have access to the currently selected accessible in the accessible tree by way of the acc variable. In addition, all functions and constants from the pyatspi package are available as locals in the console. The most important of these are the functions for querying to other accessibility interfaces. For example, to query to the Text interface: t = acc.queryText() . Imports from the current working directory or Python path are also allowed.
API Browser
This plugin shows the interfaces, methods, and attributes supported by the accessible selected in the tree view.
The API browser.
Script recorder
Accerciser's script recorder allows users to record keyboard interaction with other desktop applications for the purpose of authoring UI test scripts. Currently the plug-in supports the generation of scripts for three platforms: Dogtail, LDTP, and an Accerciser's built-in API. Once you press the "Record" button every keyboard interaction will be recorded in to a script that could be executed later as a stand alone script.
Script Recorder
The script recorder.
Quick select
This plugin provides global hotkeys for allowing quick selection of accessibles through the target application's UI. Pressing ControlAlta will select the last focused widget's accessible in Accerciser. Pressing ControlAltt will select the accessible of the widget that is under the pointer.
Validation
This plugin checks applications for accessibility problems and generates a report including the severity and description of the problems. The report links errors to documentation about how to remedy common problems. The plugin is extensible with test schemas that define rules for validation.
To run the validator, first select an item in the accessibility tree. The plugin will test the selected accessible and all of its descendants. Next select a schema to use for the test. Then click the Validate button to start the test. While the test is running, click the button again to cancel it.
When the test completes, the report table shows the severity and description of all errors. Double click a row in the table to show the associated accessible in the tree. With an item selected, click the Help to get information about how to resolve the problem.
Preferences
There are some elements in Accerciser that are configurable:
Plugin Layout
There are two methods for configuring plugin layout in Accerciser. First you may choose EditPreferences to activate the Preferences dialog. This dialog contains tabs for each section, select the Plugins tab. Under this section you will find a list view of all the available plugins. Right-click on any of the plugins listed to configure it's view.
You may bypass the Preferences dialog by using drag and drop to move plugin tabs. Dragging a plugin tab to the bottom or right plugin area in the main window will move the plugin. Dragging a tab to the desktop will create a new plugin window and drop the plugin in it.
Global Hotkey Configuration
Some elements in Accerciser may enable certain functionality via hotkeys. The hotkey combination could be changed via the Preferences dialog, to do so you may select EditPreferences to activate the Preferences dialog. This dialog contains tabs for each section, select the Global Hotkeys tab. Under this section you will find a list view of all the available hotkey features. Change the key bindings to you liking.

Accerciser
Introduction
Accerciser is an interactive Python accessibility explorer for the GNOME desktop. It uses AT-SPI to inspect and control widgets, allowing you to check if an application is providing correct information to assistive technologies and automated test frameworks. Accerciser has a simple plugin framework which you can use to create custom views of accessibility information.
In essence, Accerciser is a next generation at-poke tool.
Getting Started
To Start Accerciser
You can start Accerciser in the following ways:
Applications menu
Choose the ProgrammingAccerciser menu item.
Command line
Type the following command in a console window then press Return:
accerciser
When You Start Accerciser
When you start Accerciser, the following window is displayed.
Accerciser Main Window
Shows main window. Contains title bar, menu bar, accessible tree , right plugin display area, and bottom plugin display area. The menu bar contains File, Edit, Bookmarks, View, and Help menus.
The main Accerciser window contains the following elements:
Menubar
The menu bar contains commands for managing plugins, managing and using bookmarks, refreshing the accessible tree view, and accessing this help system.
Accessible tree view
The accessible tree view allows to view all of the accessibles starting at the desktop level. Selecting an accessible makes it available for further inspection using the loaded plugins.
Right plugin view
This is one of the two default plugin views. When Accerciser is first run, most plugins will reside here. You can drag plugin tabs to the bottom plugin view or to the desktop to show two or more plugins simultaneously.
Bottom plugin view
You can drag plugins to or from this area just like the right plugin view.
Plugin View Management
Accerciser has two modes for viewing plugins. The current view mode could be toggled with ViewSingle plugin view or by pressing Controlt. When single mode is enabled, all plugins will be put in the top right plugin view and ordered alphabetically, this could be useful for screen reader users who have no use for Accerciser's flexible plugin spacial layout scheme. When single view mode is disabled plugin tabs could be dragged and dropped in to different plugin views, or could be dragged to the desktop to put the given plugin in a new view. The placement of plugins could also be manipulated with the plugin context menu that could be brought up either from the plugin tab, or the plugin preferences dialog.
Usage
You can use Accerciser to inspect any accessible widget shown in the tree view using the available plugins. The first step is to select an accessible to inspect using one of the following methods:
Select an accessible through the tree view.
Use the tree view to navigate the hierarchy of accessible objects rooted at desktop. Unfolding a tree node reveals its immediate children while folding it hides them. Each node shows an icon for its associated application or widget role and its accessible name, if available. The second column lists how many nodes will be shown if the item is unfolded.
Using bookmarks
Accerciser allows bookmarking selected accessibles for later examining. This could be helpful if the target application must be restarted, for example after rebuilding it. To bookmark the currently selected accessible do BookmarksAdd Bookmark... or press Controld.
Bookmarks to accessibles in Accerciser are defined by an application name and a "path" in the application's internal accessible hierarchy to the bookmarked accessible. When the target application is in a different state (ie. multiple top level frames) the path might not be correct.
Bookmarks could be managed by accessing the bookmark editing dialog through BookmarksEdit Bookmarks....
Default Plugins
Accerciser comes with several default plugins. These plugins allow you to view a variety of information about the currently selected accessible in the tree view and its neighbors. The default plugins available in 0.1.5 are the following:
Interface Viewer
This plugin displays information about the available interfaces for the selected tree view accessible. Unsupported interfaces are grayed out. Various instruments for viewing and controlling an interface are available under each expander.
Interfaces that are supported by the selected accessible are shown as sensitive.
Event Monitor
This plugin monitors the selected types of events from the selected tree view accessible, from the selected tree view application, or the entire desktop.
The bottom part of the event monitor window allows you to pick the type and source of events.
By pressing ControlAltl anywhere on the desktop, the last logged event will be highlighted for later reference. See for how to change this key combination.
IPython Console
This plugin is a fully-fledged IPython console. Press Tab to show completions for the current command. Press Enter to execute any valid Python code. Commands at the console have access to the currently selected accessible in the accessible tree by way of the acc variable. In addition, all functions and constants from the pyatspi package are available as locals in the console. The most important of these are the functions for querying to other accessibility interfaces. For example, to query to the Text interface: t = acc.queryText() . Imports from the current working directory or Python path are also allowed.
API Browser
This plugin shows the interfaces, methods, and attributes supported by the accessible selected in the tree view.
The API browser.
Script recorder
Accerciser's script recorder allows users to record keyboard interaction with other desktop applications for the purpose of authoring UI test scripts. Currently the plug-in supports the generation of scripts for three platforms: Dogtail, LDTP, and an Accerciser's built-in API. Once you press the "Record" button every keyboard interaction will be recorded in to a script that could be executed later as a stand alone script.
Script Recorder
The script recorder.
Quick select
This plugin provides global hotkeys for allowing quick selection of accessibles through the target application's UI. Pressing ControlAlta will select the last focused widget's accessible in Accerciser. Pressing ControlAltt will select the accessible of the widget that is under the pointer.
Validation
This plugin checks applications for accessibility problems and generates a report including the severity and description of the problems. The report links errors to documentation about how to remedy common problems. The plugin is extensible with test schemas that define rules for validation.
To run the validator, first select an item in the accessibility tree. The plugin will test the selected accessible and all of its descendants. Next select a schema to use for the test. Then click the Validate button to start the test. While the test is running, click the button again to cancel it.
When the test completes, the report table shows the severity and description of all errors. Double click a row in the table to show the associated accessible in the tree. With an item selected, click the Help to get information about how to resolve the problem.
Preferences
There are some elements in Accerciser that are configurable:
Plugin Layout
There are two methods for configuring plugin layout in Accerciser. First you may choose EditPreferences to activate the Preferences dialog. This dialog contains tabs for each section, select the Plugins tab. Under this section you will find a list view of all the available plugins. Right-click on any of the plugins listed to configure it's view.
You may bypass the Preferences dialog by using drag and drop to move plugin tabs. Dragging a plugin tab to the bottom or right plugin area in the main window will move the plugin. Dragging a tab to the desktop will create a new plugin window and drop the plugin in it.
Global Hotkey Configuration
Some elements in Accerciser may enable certain functionality via hotkeys. The hotkey combination could be changed via the Preferences dialog, to do so you may select EditPreferences to activate the Preferences dialog. This dialog contains tabs for each section, select the Global Hotkeys tab. Under this section you will find a list view of all the available hotkey features. Change the key bindings to you liking.

Accerciser allows bookmarking items in the Application Tree View for later examining. This is helpful when the target application must be restarted - after rebuilding it, for example. To bookmark an item, select it and do BookmarksAdd Bookmark or press Ctrl+d.
Bookmarks to accessible items in Accerciser are defined by an application name and a "path" in the application's internal accessible hierarchy to the bookmarked accessible. When the target application is in a different state - i.e. multiple top level frames -, the path might not be correct. Bookmarks could be managed by accessing the bookmark editing dialog through BookmarksEdit Bookmarks.

API Browser Plugin
The API Browser Plugin allows you to verify interfaces, methods, and properties of a target accessible widget in an application.
By default, the API Browser Plugin hides private methods and properties. To see them listed, unselect the checkbox Hide Private Attributes. To hide them again, re-select this checkbox.

Accerciser allows bookmarking items in the Application Tree View for later examining. This is helpful when the target application must be restarted - after rebuilding it, for example. To bookmark an item, select it and do BookmarksAdd Bookmark or press Ctrl+d.
Bookmarks to accessible items in Accerciser are defined by an application name and a "path" in the application's internal accessible hierarchy to the bookmarked accessible. When the target application is in a different state - i.e. multiple top level frames -, the path might not be correct. Bookmarks could be managed by accessing the bookmark editing dialog through BookmarksEdit Bookmarks.
4. Event Monitor Plugin

If you want to save the output generated by the Event Monitor Plugin, just press the Save button. To clear the output screen, you just need to click the Clear button.

Running Accerciser
After that, you can use Accerciser to inspect any accessible item shown in the Application Tree View's hierarchy. Select an item and investigate it using one of Accerciser's plugins.

Just because a crosswalk looks like a hopscotch board doesn't mean it is one
Look both ways before you cross the street
Have you read the help file?
Odessa is a better game. Really.
Tourniquets are not recommended unless in the direst emergency
I could sure use a backrub right about now...
Monitors won't give you Vitamin D -- but sunlight will...
If you're ever lost and alone in the woods, hug a tree
Fishing wire makes bad dental floss
Consistency is key
When without a stapler, a staple and a ruler will work
Never blow in a dog's ear

Introduction
AisleRiot
AisleRiot (also known as Solitaire or sol) is a collection of card games which are easy to play with the aid of a mouse. The rules for the games have been coded for your pleasure in the GNOME scripting language (Scheme).
Playing AisleRiot
Use the mouse to move cards. Click a card and drag it somewhere. Release the mouse button to deposit the card.
Alternatively, you can move a card by clicking once to pick it up and clicking again to place it. To enable this way of moving cards, choose ControlClick to move. This can be faster than dragging and will be easier on your hand since you don't have to hold the mouse down. However, it may take a while to get used to.
If a card can be moved to the foundation(s), you do not need to drag it. You can double-click on it and it will move. If a sequence of cards can be moved to the foundations, you can generally move the sequence as one move.
Double clicking a card will send it to a foundation, if that is possible. This is useful for cleaning up large numbers of cards at the end of a successful game.
In games which have a stock pile you can redeal it by clicking on the empty space where it was. Be warned that some games only let you do this a limited number of time. Watch for the Redeals Left message at the bottom of the window.
A useful tip to know is that right-clicking on a face-up card which is partially obscured by a card laid over it will raise it so that you can see what it is.
Some games have options to change the way the game is played. For example Klondike can be played with either single card deals or three-card deals. In these games there is a separate menu with the game's name. You can only change the rules of the game at the beginning of the game - the menu will be inactive during the game.
Statistics on how well you have done at a particular game are available by selecting Statistics from the Game menu. Only games where you actually start moving cards are counted. The statistics are here for your own enjoyment, there are numerous ways to cheat and it is unwise to make comparisons.
The Games
Accordion
Written by Ed Sirett
Setup
Type of Deck
Standard Deck
Tableau
Fifty-four spaces in five rows of nine and a last row of seven. Deal cards face up one per space. The spaces should be considered as one continuous line, the rows simply arrange the tableau so all of it can be seen at once. Thus the rightmost space of a row is to be considered to the left of the leftmost space of the row below.
Goal
To remove all cards except one.
Rules
Cards are moved singly. Any card can be moved over another card of the same suit or rank that is in the space immediately to its left or three spaces to its left. The card that is covered is removed from play. All the cards (if any) in spaces to the right of the resulting gap are moved to the left one space so as to close the gap. Double-clicking causes the card to move three spaces, if possible, or failing that one space to the left.
Scoring
Each card removed scores 1 point.
Maximum possible score: 51
Strategy
Agnes
Written by Rosanna Yuen
Stock
Top left pile. The rest of the deck is placed here after dealing the Tableau. Cards are dealt in batches of seven, one on every Tableau pile.
Foundation
Four piles top right. To be built in suit and sequence, wrapping from King to Ace when necessary. One card is dealt on to the first Foundation pile. The other Foundation piles must be started with cards of the same rank.
Seven piles. Deal card face up in first pile. Place one card face down on all other piles. Place one card face up on next pile followed by one card face down on all the covered piles. Repeat until there are seven cards in last pile. Tableau can be built down in same colors. Groups of cards can be moved. Empty piles can only be filled by the next deal from the Stock.
Move all cards to the Foundation piles.
Cards in the Tableau are built down by same color. Groups of cards in sequence and same color can be moved as a unit.
Each deal flips one card from the Stock to each pile of the Tableau. There are no redeals.
Foundations are built up in suit in sequence, wrapping from King to Ace when necessary. Cards in Foundations are still in play. Double clicking on a card in the Tableau will move it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible.
Each card in Foundation scores one point.
Maximum possible score: 52
Try to build down in suit whenever possible. Try to score as many points as you can as this game is very hard to win.
Athena
Written by Alan Horkan, based on work by Jonathan Blandford
Top left pile. The rest of the deck is placed here after dealing on to the Tableau. Cards are turned over one at a time to Waste. Two redeals.
Waste
To be taken from Stock. Top card available for play.
Foundations
Four piles top right. To be built up in suit from Ace to King. Topmost card in each Foundation can be played back on to the Tableau.
Seven piles. Four rows, the first row is face down, the second row is face up, the third row is face down, and the fourth and final row is face up. Essentially Athena is the same as Klondike only the opening layout is different. Tableau can be built down in alternating colors. Builds of cards can be moved. Empty piles can only be filled by Kings or group of cards starting with a King.
Cards in the Tableau are built down by alternating color. Builds of cards can be moved. An empty pile in the Tableau can be filled with a King or a group of cards with a King on the bottom.
Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste individually. Top card in Waste is in play. When Stock is empty, move all cards in Waste back to the Stock, maintaining order. You can go through the deck three times.
Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King. Cards in Foundations are still in play. Double clicking on a card will move it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible.
Each card in the Foundation piles scores one point.
Don't give up the ship! Try brute force methods when the game seems over. Sometimes a combination of using cards already in the Foundation and rearranging sequences will free up some needed cards.
Auld Lang Syne
Top left pile. All cards except the Aces are placed here at the start of play. Clicking on the Stock will deal one card to each of the four Reserve piles.
Four piles on top, to the right of Stock. Place an Ace on each Foundation to begin the game. The Foundation piles are to be built up regardless of suit.
Reserve
Four piles placed underneath Foundations. Each time Stock is clicked, one card will be placed on each Reserve pile. Top card is available for play. Reserve cards can only be moved on to Foundations.
Move all cards on to Foundations.
Play begins by dealing four cards to the Reserve. If possible, play cards on to the Foundation from the Reserve. Continue this process until no cards are left in stock and no more moves on to Foundation can be made. A similar game that is a bit easier is Scuffle.
Each card removed scores one point.
Do you believe in Luck? Although this game takes more skill to play than Clock, the skill involved entails paying attention. A great game for brainless play.
Aunt Mary
Six piles, deal card face up in first pile. Place one card face down on all other piles. Place one card face up on the first two piles then one card face down on all covered piles. Place three cards face up and the rest face down and so on. Repeat gradually revealing more cards each time until there are six rows with six cards. Tableau can be built down in alternating colors. Builds of cards can be moved. Empty piles can only be filled by Kings or group of cards starting with a King.
Aunt Mary is extremely difficult and rarely solvable. The real challenge is not finishing but seeing how far you can get.
Backbone
Written by Vincent Povirk
Double Deck
Single pile below the foundations on the left. The rest of the deck is placed here after dealing on to the Tableau and Reserve. Cards are turned over one at a time to Waste. One redeal.
Single pile to the right of the Stock. To be taken from Stock. Top card available for play.
Eight piles top right. To be built up in suit from Ace to King.
Two stacks of 9 cards each, with a single above both stacks. Cards that are not obscured are available for play to anywhere except empty tableau spaces.
Eight piles, four on each side of the reserve. A card is dealt to each tableau pile when the game starts. Build down in suit. Empty spaces can be filled with any card. Only one card can be moved at a time.
Cards in the Tableau are built down by suit. Only one card can be moved at a time. Empty slots can be filled with any card except from the reserve.
Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste individually. Top card in Waste is in play. When Stock is empty, move all cards in Waste back to the Stock, maintaining order. You can go through the deck twice.
Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King. Cards in the Foundations are no longer in play. Double clicking on a card will move it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible.
Maximum possible score: 104
You can use empty spaces in the Tableau to move multiple cards. Be careful with Kings in the Reserve: the only way to remove them is by playing them to a Foundation on top of a Queen.

Introduction
AisleRiot
AisleRiot (also known as Solitaire or sol) is a collection of card games which are easy to play with the aid of a mouse. The rules for the games have been coded for your pleasure in the GNOME scripting language (Scheme).
Playing AisleRiot
Use the mouse to move cards. Click a card and drag it somewhere. Release the mouse button to deposit the card.
Alternatively, you can move a card by clicking once to pick it up and clicking again to place it. To enable this way of moving cards, choose ControlClick to move. This can be faster than dragging and will be easier on your hand since you don't have to hold the mouse down. However, it may take a while to get used to.
If a card can be moved to the foundation(s), you do not need to drag it. You can double-click on it and it will move. If a sequence of cards can be moved to the foundations, you can generally move the sequence as one move.
Double clicking a card will send it to a foundation, if that is possible. This is useful for cleaning up large numbers of cards at the end of a successful game.
In games which have a stock pile you can redeal it by clicking on the empty space where it was. Be warned that some games only let you do this a limited number of time. Watch for the Redeals Left message at the bottom of the window.
A useful tip to know is that right-clicking on a face-up card which is partially obscured by a card laid over it will raise it so that you can see what it is.
Some games have options to change the way the game is played. For example Klondike can be played with either single card deals or three-card deals. In these games there is a separate menu with the game's name. You can only change the rules of the game at the beginning of the game - the menu will be inactive during the game.
Statistics on how well you have done at a particular game are available by selecting Statistics from the Game menu. Only games where you actually start moving cards are counted. The statistics are here for your own enjoyment, there are numerous ways to cheat and it is unwise to make comparisons.
The Games
Accordion
Written by Ed Sirett
Setup
Type of Deck
Standard Deck
Tableau
Fifty-four spaces in five rows of nine and a last row of seven. Deal cards face up one per space. The spaces should be considered as one continuous line, the rows simply arrange the tableau so all of it can be seen at once. Thus the rightmost space of a row is to be considered to the left of the leftmost space of the row below.
Goal
To remove all cards except one.
Rules
Cards are moved singly. Any card can be moved over another card of the same suit or rank that is in the space immediately to its left or three spaces to its left. The card that is covered is removed from play. All the cards (if any) in spaces to the right of the resulting gap are moved to the left one space so as to close the gap. Double-clicking causes the card to move three spaces, if possible, or failing that one space to the left.
Scoring
Each card removed scores 1 point.
Maximum possible score: 51
Strategy
Agnes
Written by Rosanna Yuen
Stock
Top left pile. The rest of the deck is placed here after dealing the Tableau. Cards are dealt in batches of seven, one on every Tableau pile.
Foundation
Four piles top right. To be built in suit and sequence, wrapping from King to Ace when necessary. One card is dealt on to the first Foundation pile. The other Foundation piles must be started with cards of the same rank.
Seven piles. Deal card face up in first pile. Place one card face down on all other piles. Place one card face up on next pile followed by one card face down on all the covered piles. Repeat until there are seven cards in last pile. Tableau can be built down in same colors. Groups of cards can be moved. Empty piles can only be filled by the next deal from the Stock.
Move all cards to the Foundation piles.
Cards in the Tableau are built down by same color. Groups of cards in sequence and same color can be moved as a unit.
Each deal flips one card from the Stock to each pile of the Tableau. There are no redeals.
Foundations are built up in suit in sequence, wrapping from King to Ace when necessary. Cards in Foundations are still in play. Double clicking on a card in the Tableau will move it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible.
Each card in Foundation scores one point.
Maximum possible score: 52
Try to build down in suit whenever possible. Try to score as many points as you can as this game is very hard to win.
Athena
Written by Alan Horkan, based on work by Jonathan Blandford
Top left pile. The rest of the deck is placed here after dealing on to the Tableau. Cards are turned over one at a time to Waste. Two redeals.
Waste
To be taken from Stock. Top card available for play.
Foundations
Four piles top right. To be built up in suit from Ace to King. Topmost card in each Foundation can be played back on to the Tableau.
Seven piles. Four rows, the first row is face down, the second row is face up, the third row is face down, and the fourth and final row is face up. Essentially Athena is the same as Klondike only the opening layout is different. Tableau can be built down in alternating colors. Builds of cards can be moved. Empty piles can only be filled by Kings or group of cards starting with a King.
Cards in the Tableau are built down by alternating color. Builds of cards can be moved. An empty pile in the Tableau can be filled with a King or a group of cards with a King on the bottom.
Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste individually. Top card in Waste is in play. When Stock is empty, move all cards in Waste back to the Stock, maintaining order. You can go through the deck three times.
Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King. Cards in Foundations are still in play. Double clicking on a card will move it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible.
Each card in the Foundation piles scores one point.
Don't give up the ship! Try brute force methods when the game seems over. Sometimes a combination of using cards already in the Foundation and rearranging sequences will free up some needed cards.
Auld Lang Syne
Top left pile. All cards except the Aces are placed here at the start of play. Clicking on the Stock will deal one card to each of the four Reserve piles.
Four piles on top, to the right of Stock. Place an Ace on each Foundation to begin the game. The Foundation piles are to be built up regardless of suit.
Reserve
Four piles placed underneath Foundations. Each time Stock is clicked, one card will be placed on each Reserve pile. Top card is available for play. Reserve cards can only be moved on to Foundations.
Move all cards on to Foundations.
Play begins by dealing four cards to the Reserve. If possible, play cards on to the Foundation from the Reserve. Continue this process until no cards are left in stock and no more moves on to Foundation can be made. A similar game that is a bit easier is Scuffle.
Each card removed scores one point.
Do you believe in Luck? Although this game takes more skill to play than Clock, the skill involved entails paying attention. A great game for brainless play.
Aunt Mary
Six piles, deal card face up in first pile. Place one card face down on all other piles. Place one card face up on the first two piles then one card face down on all covered piles. Place three cards face up and the rest face down and so on. Repeat gradually revealing more cards each time until there are six rows with six cards. Tableau can be built down in alternating colors. Builds of cards can be moved. Empty piles can only be filled by Kings or group of cards starting with a King.
Aunt Mary is extremely difficult and rarely solvable. The real challenge is not finishing but seeing how far you can get.
Backbone
Written by Vincent Povirk
Double Deck
Single pile below the foundations on the left. The rest of the deck is placed here after dealing on to the Tableau and Reserve. Cards are turned over one at a time to Waste. One redeal.
Single pile to the right of the Stock. To be taken from Stock. Top card available for play.
Eight piles top right. To be built up in suit from Ace to King.
Two stacks of 9 cards each, with a single above both stacks. Cards that are not obscured are available for play to anywhere except empty tableau spaces.
Eight piles, four on each side of the reserve. A card is dealt to each tableau pile when the game starts. Build down in suit. Empty spaces can be filled with any card. Only one card can be moved at a time.
Cards in the Tableau are built down by suit. Only one card can be moved at a time. Empty slots can be filled with any card except from the reserve.
Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste individually. Top card in Waste is in play. When Stock is empty, move all cards in Waste back to the Stock, maintaining order. You can go through the deck twice.
Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King. Cards in the Foundations are no longer in play. Double clicking on a card will move it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible.
Maximum possible score: 104
You can use empty spaces in the Tableau to move multiple cards. Be careful with Kings in the Reserve: the only way to remove them is by playing them to a Foundation on top of a Queen.

Odessa is a better game. Really.
Tourniquets are not recommended unless in the direst emergency
I could sure use a backrub right about now...
Monitors won't give you Vitamin D -- but sunlight will...

Fishing wire makes bad dental floss
Consistency is key
When without a stapler, a staple and a ruler will work
Never blow in a dog's ear

Introduction
AisleRiot
AisleRiot (also known as Solitaire or sol) is a collection of card games which are easy to play with the aid of a mouse. The rules for the games have been coded for your pleasure in the GNOME scripting language (Scheme).
Playing AisleRiot
Use the mouse to move cards. Click a card and drag it somewhere. Release the mouse button to deposit the card.
Alternatively, you can move a card by clicking once to pick it up and clicking again to place it. To enable this way of moving cards, choose ControlClick to move. This can be faster than dragging and will be easier on your hand since you don't have to hold the mouse down. However, it may take a while to get used to.
If a card can be moved to the foundation(s), you do not need to drag it. You can double-click on it and it will move. If a sequence of cards can be moved to the foundations, you can generally move the sequence as one move.
Double clicking a card will send it to a foundation, if that is possible. This is useful for cleaning up large numbers of cards at the end of a successful game.
In games which have a stock pile you can redeal it by clicking on the empty space where it was. Be warned that some games only let you do this a limited number of time. Watch for the Redeals Left message at the bottom of the window.
A useful tip to know is that right-clicking on a face-up card which is partially obscured by a card laid over it will raise it so that you can see what it is.
Some games have options to change the way the game is played. For example Klondike can be played with either single card deals or three-card deals. In these games there is a separate menu with the game's name. You can only change the rules of the game at the beginning of the game - the menu will be inactive during the game.
Statistics on how well you have done at a particular game are available by selecting Statistics from the Game menu. Only games where you actually start moving cards are counted. The statistics are here for your own enjoyment, there are numerous ways to cheat and it is unwise to make comparisons.
The Games
Accordion

Setup
Type of Deck
Standard Deck
Tableau
Fifty-four spaces in five rows of nine and a last row of seven. Deal cards face up one per space. The spaces should be considered as one continuous line, the rows simply arrange the tableau so all of it can be seen at once. Thus the rightmost space of a row is to be considered to the left of the leftmost space of the row below.
Goal
To remove all cards except one.
Rules
Cards are moved singly. Any card can be moved over another card of the same suit or rank that is in the space immediately to its left or three spaces to its left. The card that is covered is removed from play. All the cards (if any) in spaces to the right of the resulting gap are moved to the left one space so as to close the gap. Double-clicking causes the card to move three spaces, if possible, or failing that one space to the left.
Scoring
Each card removed scores 1 point.
Maximum possible score: 51
Strategy
Agnes
Written by Rosanna Yuen
Stock
Top left pile. The rest of the deck is placed here after dealing the Tableau. Cards are dealt in batches of seven, one on every Tableau pile.
Foundation
Four piles top right. To be built in suit and sequence, wrapping from King to Ace when necessary. One card is dealt on to the first Foundation pile. The other Foundation piles must be started with cards of the same rank.
Seven piles. Deal card face up in first pile. Place one card face down on all other piles. Place one card face up on next pile followed by one card face down on all the covered piles. Repeat until there are seven cards in last pile. Tableau can be built down in same colors. Groups of cards can be moved. Empty piles can only be filled by the next deal from the Stock.
Move all cards to the Foundation piles.
Cards in the Tableau are built down by same color. Groups of cards in sequence and same color can be moved as a unit.
Each deal flips one card from the Stock to each pile of the Tableau. There are no redeals.
Foundations are built up in suit in sequence, wrapping from King to Ace when necessary. Cards in Foundations are still in play. Double clicking on a card in the Tableau will move it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible.
Each card in Foundation scores one point.
Maximum possible score: 52
Try to build down in suit whenever possible. Try to score as many points as you can as this game is very hard to win.
Athena
Written by Alan Horkan, based on work by Jonathan Blandford
Top left pile. The rest of the deck is placed here after dealing on to the Tableau. Cards are turned over one at a time to Waste. Two redeals.
Waste
To be taken from Stock. Top card available for play.
Foundations
Four piles top right. To be built up in suit from Ace to King. Topmost card in each Foundation can be played back on to the Tableau.
Seven piles. Four rows, the first row is face down, the second row is face up, the third row is face down, and the fourth and final row is face up. Essentially Athena is the same as Klondike only the opening layout is different. Tableau can be built down in alternating colors. Builds of cards can be moved. Empty piles can only be filled by Kings or group of cards starting with a King.
Cards in the Tableau are built down by alternating color. Builds of cards can be moved. An empty pile in the Tableau can be filled with a King or a group of cards with a King on the bottom.
Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste individually. Top card in Waste is in play. When Stock is empty, move all cards in Waste back to the Stock, maintaining order. You can go through the deck three times.
Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King. Cards in Foundations are still in play. Double clicking on a card will move it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible.
Each card in the Foundation piles scores one point.
Don't give up the ship! Try brute force methods when the game seems over. Sometimes a combination of using cards already in the Foundation and rearranging sequences will free up some needed cards.
Auld Lang Syne
Top left pile. All cards except the Aces are placed here at the start of play. Clicking on the Stock will deal one card to each of the four Reserve piles.
Four piles on top, to the right of Stock. Place an Ace on each Foundation to begin the game. The Foundation piles are to be built up regardless of suit.
Reserve
Four piles placed underneath Foundations. Each time Stock is clicked, one card will be placed on each Reserve pile. Top card is available for play. Reserve cards can only be moved on to Foundations.
Move all cards on to Foundations.
Play begins by dealing four cards to the Reserve. If possible, play cards on to the Foundation from the Reserve. Continue this process until no cards are left in stock and no more moves on to Foundation can be made. A similar game that is a bit easier is Scuffle.
Each card removed scores one point.
Do you believe in Luck? Although this game takes more skill to play than Clock, the skill involved entails paying attention. A great game for brainless play.
Aunt Mary
Six piles, deal card face up in first pile. Place one card face down on all other piles. Place one card face up on the first two piles then one card face down on all covered piles. Place three cards face up and the rest face down and so on. Repeat gradually revealing more cards each time until there are six rows with six cards. Tableau can be built down in alternating colors. Builds of cards can be moved. Empty piles can only be filled by Kings or group of cards starting with a King.
Aunt Mary is extremely difficult and rarely solvable. The real challenge is not finishing but seeing how far you can get.
Backbone
Written by Vincent Povirk
Double Deck
Single pile below the foundations on the left. The rest of the deck is placed here after dealing on to the Tableau and Reserve. Cards are turned over one at a time to Waste. One redeal.
Single pile to the right of the Stock. To be taken from Stock. Top card available for play.
Eight piles top right. To be built up in suit from Ace to King.
Two stacks of 9 cards each, with a single above both stacks. Cards that are not obscured are available for play to anywhere except empty tableau spaces.
Eight piles, four on each side of the reserve. A card is dealt to each tableau pile when the game starts. Build down in suit. Empty spaces can be filled with any card. Only one card can be moved at a time.
Cards in the Tableau are built down by suit. Only one card can be moved at a time. Empty slots can be filled with any card except from the reserve.
Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste individually. Top card in Waste is in play. When Stock is empty, move all cards in Waste back to the Stock, maintaining order. You can go through the deck twice.
Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King. Cards in the Foundations are no longer in play. Double clicking on a card will move it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible.
Maximum possible score: 104
You can use empty spaces in the Tableau to move multiple cards. Be careful with Kings in the Reserve: the only way to remove them is by playing them to a Foundation on top of a Queen.
