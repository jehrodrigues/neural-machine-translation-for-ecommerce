Results from the first transplants using stem cells in Brazil usher in the prospect of using this technique against cardiac arrest, one of the main causes of death in the world
Ricardo Zorzetto
These are the stem cells, intensely studied over the last five years because of their fantastic peculiarity: that of multiplying themselves and ending up as the cells of the different body tissues, as distinct as those of the skin, muscle and the nervous system.
In Brazil, results from at least three research groups have come out which, in parallel with European and North American teams, consolidate the stem cells as an option for -- if not a cure -- at least improving the quality of life of people with serious heart problems, against which medicines no longer produce the desired effects.
Using distinct techniques, researchers from the States of Rio de Janeiro, Bahia and S達o Paulo have concluded that the transplanting of stem cells is a promising alternative against chronic cardiac insufficiency brought on by hypertension, obstruction of the coronary arteries and by Chagas's disease.
A problem in which the heart progressively loses its capacity to pump blood, cardiac insufficiency hits between 3% and 6% of the world's population, and in Brazil between five to ten million people.
The team from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) and the Pro-Cardiac Hospital, which published the most advanced data, recently obtained an international triumph for their results which they arrived at after two year's work, a short period of time when dealing with a new area worldwide.
On the 13th of May, the magazineCirculation , the most important scientific magazine dealing with clinical cardiology, published an article in which the researchers from Rio describe the first transplants using stem cells in sufferers from chronic cardiac insufficiency.
Of the fourteen patients treated, twelve are doing well and two have died, apparently through causes not linked to the use of the stem cells, according to the doctors.
"The project only went so quickly because we had already had at the UFRJ a model for transplant in rats when we initiated the study", recognizes the cardiologist Hans Dohmann, from the Pro-Cardiac Hospital.
"The impression is that the totipotent use substitute the fibrous tissue for muscular cells", comments Antonio Carlos Campos de Carvalho from UFRJ, which works with the Millennium Institute of Tissue Bioengineering, supported by the federal government.
This treatment increases the irrigation of the injured part of the heart, allowing the cells that have entered into a type hibernation to return to contracting themselves.
At the same time a group from the Heart Institute (Incor) and the School of Medicine of the University of S達o Paulo (USP) applied these cells in nine patients suffering from cardiac insufficiency caused by hypertension, Chagas's disease or of unknown origin.
Four months afterwards three were no longer on the list for heart transplants, five improved considerably and one died, death being attributed to the serious state of health the patient before entering into the experiment.
"Looking at the as yet restricted number of patients, it is early to talk confidently about the efficiency of these techniques", comments the cardiologist Edimar Bocchi from USP, one of the research coordinators.
"But the results point to the prospect of improvement for these people who have an extremely serious illness."
In practical terms, the teams from Rio and S達o Paulo have maintained beating -- with a good part of their previous vigor -- the hearts of men and women who could no longer walk in the morning to the baker's shop nor feed themselves, such was the dimension of the tiredness brought on by cardiac insufficiency.
Before the treatment with stem cells, the only solution for them was to wait for months for a heart transplant.
If they managed to resist, they would confront surgery that begins with a cut of some thirty centimeters in the thorax, finishes some nine hours later, demands a month for recovery, and in total the bill runs up to R$ 200,000.
The implanting of stem cells is much simpler.
During this month, Santos in partnership with cardiologists from the Santa Izabel Hospital, also in the State capital of Bahia, intends to begin a study with five patients suffering from cardiac insufficiency caused by Chagas's disease, the illness brought on by the protozoaTrypanosoma cruzi , the parasite that lodges in the cells of the heart.
In recent research, Santos demonstrated that the use of this type of cell reduces in a long-standing manner the inflamed and damaged areas of the heart of mice with Chagas's disease.
This could be a way of keeping the health heart free of trouble so that under these circumstances the parasite, which causes an illness that affects sixteen million people in Latin America of who six million are Brazilians, can then be fought against.
Only at the beginning
Even with these results some years will still be necessary before this type of treatment becomes available to the population both in the public and private health systems.
The experiments are merely the start of a long trajectory until the approval of new medicines or medical procedures for human beings.
This is called phase 1 of clinical studies objective of which is to investigate if the treatment is safe and does not cause any serious side effects.
This is followed by other stages in which the efficiency of the treatment in tens and then thousands of patients are analyzed.
The Brazilian researchers are by-passing the ethical questions associated with the use of these cells because they are working with only one of the two types in existence.
They are using adult stem cells, produced by the bone marrow of the individual himself that he will later receive in the transplant.
In this manner, they are avoiding the controversial question surrounding the use of the other type of stem cells, the embryonic stem cells, so-called because they are removed from embryos with only a few days of life.
This is exactly the reason for the controversy as the embryo dies when the cells are extracted.
More versatile than the adult cells, the embryonic stem cells are capable of originating all types of body cells.
For this reason, countries with legislation considered to be more liberal, such as Britain, have limited research to the cells removed from embryos discarded in the treatment of assisted fertilization.
Nobody can also forget the more conservative attitude adopted by the President of the United States, George W. Bush, who has restricted federal financing only to studies with sixty two strains of embryonic stem cells already characterized in the laboratory.
In a situation in which the scientific result receives help by accident, the project of the implanting of stem cells in the heart was born from a solution in search of a problem.
During 2000, Hans Dohmann, from the Pro-Cardiac Hospital in Rio, had been working with the Brazilian cardiologist Emerson Perin at the Texas Heart Institute, building a special catheter using a fine needle and sensors capable of identifying the dead portions of the heart.
In this same year, they got to know at a meeting in Hamburg, Germany, that another team had completed the catheter before them.
It was at that point that the specialists recognized that the gadget could be used in research with stem cells.
"On the plane coming back to Rio, I was imagining that we would need cooperation with foreign teams in the case I decided to get involved in this area", recalls Dohmann.
By chance he had fooled himself.
In Rio, Radovan Borojevic and Antonio Carlos Campos de Carvalho, both from UFRJ, had initiated a study on the application of stem cells to mice with artificially brought on cardiac insufficiency.
This is something similar to what is observed when there is an accumulation of fatty tissue in the coronary arteries that diminishes the flow of blood to the heart.
This reduction kills some areas of the heart, which then stops pumping blood in an efficient manner to the body.
In an attempt to compensate for the lack of force, the heart increases in size, reaching double the normal in the most serious cases, as it can be seen on page 35.
The green light for the work came through in October of 2001, five months after Carvalho and Borojevic had verified in mice that the stem cells incorporated themselves into the heart muscle, and, even more importantly, restored, at least in part, its capacity to self-contract.
"There are as yet no detailed studies that explain what is happening", comments Carvalho.
Little by little the researchers from Rio demonstrated, in a pioneering manner, that this type of cellular therapy re-establishes the pumping of the blood by the heart in the most complicated cases of cardiac insufficiency, in which the problem turns chronic and the patient feels fine only when he is sitting down.
Under these conditions, the medicines that impede the increase of the size of the heart -- such as beta-blockers and the inhibitors for the angiotensin converting enzyme -- stop producing the desired effect.
In some cases, it also becomes impossible to treat the disease using traditional therapies such as angioplasty, the introduction of a catheter with a balloon on the tip, which squashes the plaques of fat, or the implant of a bridge, a way of detouring the blocked area by using veins removed from the leg or the pectoral region.
In the most severe cases, cardiac insufficiency kills half of the patients in six months.
Before this Brazilian study, Bodo Strauer, from the University of D端sseldorf, in Germany, had published in September of 2002 in theCirculation magazine an article in which he described an increase in the blood flow rate of the heart in patients who had received applications of stem cells.
However, the study took into consideration only people who had suffered acute heart attacks and where part of the heart had remained close to a week without an adequate supply of blood.
Furthermore, the capacity of these patients to pump blood was higher than the one shown by the Brazilians -- which made their recovery simpler than when the problem became chronic.
With the approval of Conep, Dohmann and Perin selected their twenty-one volunteers who were integrated into the initial phase of the clinical study.
Each person who was submitted to the therapy with stem cells passed through the same procedure: by way of a small cut in the highest portion of the hip, the doctors introduced a needle into the ilium bone, which forms the bulging sides of the pelvis, and they extracted 50 ml of material drawn from the bone marrow.
This viscous and dark red colored liquid consists of a mixture of cells, very rich in adult stem cells that are afterwards separated in the laboratory.
Back in the surgery theater four hours later, Dohmann and Perin had in their hands a red concentrate of live stem cells.
With the catheter, thirty million of them were injected into the internal wall of the left ventricle -- the most important of the four heart chambers, which pumps blood rich in oxygen to the body.
They applied the stem cells in the areas in which the cardiac muscle had gone into a type of hibernation -- inactive although still alive.
Four months afterwards it was noted that the transplant had stimulated the appearance of small arteries in the region of the heart that had lost the capacity to self-contract.
With the improvement in the blood flow rate, the area that is short of blood decreased by 73% and the capacity to pump from the heart increased from 20% to 29%, sufficient to allow that the transplanted patients increased from five to seven minutes their time for slow steps on a treadmill.
The doctors have compared the quality of life of the people who received the stem cells before the treatment and six months after the application.
On average, they found them the same as or better than Americans of the same age.
The seven members of the control group who took only medicine against cardiac insufficiency did not present any relevant improvement in the condition of their health during the same period.
According to Dohmann, they should also receive the implantation of stem cells, possibly starting in August.
In a second phase of this study, forecast to begin at the end of this year, the researchers from Rio de Janeiro intend to analyze the performance of this technique in a larger group composed of one hundred and twenty patients with chronic cardiac insufficiency.
Cellular reinforcement
In Sao Paulo the cardiologists Edimar Bocchi and Dalton Chamone have also verified an increase in the force of the heartbeat, restored by techniques distinct from the treatment with stem cells.
Instead of extracting these cells directly from the bone and injecting them into the cardiac muscle, Bocchi and Chamone were able to count upon the collaboration of the organism itself.
When they reach a certain concentration the doctors sent the transplant candidates for a series of blood filtering to separate out the stem cells which were then frozen and stored before being once again injected into the bloodstream.
Of the nine patients between the ages of thirty-three and sixty-five, two received injections of stem cells into their coronary arteries by way of a catheter.
The other seven only injections of GM-CSF -- and all of the remaining work had to be done by the organism itself.
It is believed that the damaged tissue, like that of the injured heart, exercises a type of chemical attraction on the stem cells through the release of proteins that spur the communication between cells, such as the interleukin 6 and the Human Tumor necrosis factor-alpha.
It was not only the methods that varied.
The people treated at Incor had cardiac insufficiency caused not by blocking of the veins but by causes as varied as Chagas's disease, increase of blood pressure (hypertension) or even an increase in the size of the heart without any known reason -- an infirmity known in medical jargon as idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.
In a general manner, the capacity to pump blood and the oxygen intake increased and three patients had their names taken off the heart transplant list.
Today they are only taking the medicine needed to control cardiac insufficiency.
Two of them still present a problem that normally reaches 20 % of cardiac insufficiency sufferers: the blocking by coagulant blood of the artery that leads the blood poor in oxygen to the lungs.
"An apparent small increase in the capacity to pump blood many times represents a significant improvement for the patients", Bocchi explains.
After getting into the blood stream, the parasite that causes the disease, the protozoa namedTrypanosoma cruzi , lodges in the interior of the cardiac cells, which sets off an alert to the immune system.
But the parasite is not the only one that loses.
The heart cells have on their surface proteins similar to those of trypanosome and for this reason they also suffer an attack from the defense cells.
As a consequence, thousands of scars appear throughout the organ.
An aggravation to the problem is that infection by the trypanosome is more frequent in the population of rural areas, especially in the North and Northeast Regions in which there are no heart transplant programs.
Stem cells could alleviate this problem.
In mice, as Santos verified, one only needs to give an injection of 20 million stems cells associated to the use of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, the GM-CSF, in order to reduce the inflammation and the fibrous tissue of the heart.
After two months, the mice treated using this method showed 80% fewer inflamed cells and fibrous tissue than the mice that had not received this therapy.
The most important aspect is that this benefit seems to be long lasting: the improvement persisted for six months after the mice received the stem cells, a period equivalent to almost twenty years for human beings.
In a recently approved experiment by Conep, Santos is going to inject 30 million of these cells into the interior of the coronary arteries, as well as GM-CSF, initially in five patients with cardiac insufficiency caused by Chagas's disease.
If the technique shows itself to be secure, the researcher from Fiocruz will widen and detail the study with a further twenty-five patients -- five should receive stem cells and GM-CSF, ten will be treated only with stem cells and ten with medicine.
"Using this therapy we hope to reduce the lesions on the heart to the minimal level, similar to those that occur with 70% of the carriers of Chagas's disease who do not develop cardiac insufficiency", says Santos.
If a success, the treatment will allow that the doctors can give to the patients a medicine to combat the protozoa, named benznidazole, which, as it is toxic, cannot be used with people suffering from cardiac insufficiency.

Virtual opportunity
The Tidia Program will select projects concerning the infrastructure of the network and distance learning
FAPESP is launching a tender for the registration of research groups into the Information Technology for the Development of the Advanced Internet Program (Tidia).
Established in 2001, the program aims to stimulate research into new technologies for the Internet, offering the necessary optical fiber infrastructure for carrying out tests on hardware equipment, the development of software and the creation of digital academic content, with emphasis on distance learning.
"We are going to make available a high speed optical fiber network to make possible experiments which, carried out in the laboratory, might not reflect the behavior of the technologies in the real world", comments Luis Fernandez Lopes, the president of Tidia's coordinating commission.
The program, which is based on the cooperation between research centers and anticipates partnerships with business and the government, has three large areas: the infrastructure of the network, known as the test bed, incubator of digital content and distance learning (e-learning).
In the first, the researchers can make use of switched off optical fibers, that is, inactive, for tests.
"For example, the network could serve as a test field to evaluate equipment for the broadening of transmission bands or a communication protocol", observes Hugo Fragnito, Tidia's coordinator in the area of infrastructure.
Democratizing access
The second area of research included in the program anticipates support for research in the development of software and academic content, benefiting projects on digitalizing libraries, among others.
"The production of didactic material that could be accessed from any location and at any moment demands an enormous effort in standardization and a lot of care to make sure of good interactivity, flexibility and ease of use", comments Wilson Vicente Ruggiero, Tidia's coordinator in the area of distance learning.
All of the tools used in the projects will have open code, or that is to say, will allow for correction and control of application.
FAPESP is beginning to sign agreements with telecommunication service providers so as to offer to researchers a network of switched off optical fiber, linking, in the first instance Sao Paulo, Campinas and S達o Carlos, at a velocity of 400 gigabits per second.
To have an idea of what this means, it is worth recalling that the connections in domestic wide band operate at velocities varying between 256 kilobits and 2 megabits per second.

Team from the state of Minas Gerais discover a network of tubes that store calcium in the nucleus of cells
One single piece of research knocks down two myths at the same time.
The first: in the nucleus of cells there isn't just the chromosomes, made up of proteins and DNA, as it was thought for at least fifty years.
Within there is also, as the Brazilian and American researchers have discovered, a network of tubes that store calcium -- a chemical element essential for the working of the cell.
"This is the first time that anyone has shown that the nucleus contains its own organelles", comments Maria de F叩tima Leite, a researcher at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) and the co-author of this work, published on the 22nd of April in the on-line edition ofNature Cell Biology .
Maria de F叩tima and Michael Nathanson, from Yale University in the United States, have verified that such organelles -- or compartments called endoplamastic reticulum -- at least occur in liver cells.
"It is probable that the cells of the heart, muscles and nervous system also possess this structure", she adds.
The second undone idea is that the nucleus will receive calcium only from the cytoplasm, the gelatinous portion that occupies the space between the nucleus and the cell's external membrane.
It is in the cytoplasm that compartments with various functions are found, an example being the smooth endoplasmatic reticulum, a type of bag that entraps the calcium.
The team's finding suggests that it is possible that the calcium passed through the membrane of the nucleus but there is no longer any way of denying the self-sufficiency of the nucleus regarding this chemical element, essential in regulating muscular contraction, in heart beating , in hormones secretion, in cell multiplication and differentiation and in the so-called neuronal plasticity -- the capacity of the brain to create alternative routes to maintain the body functioning or to rescue memory.
In the nucleus, the calcium could also change the structure of the DNA molecule, and activate or deactivate genes.
Cited in the section Editors' Choice of the magazineScience of the 9th of May, the paper by the researchers from UFMG and Yale helps to understand how one single chemical element -- even though it is abundant in the interior of the cells -- can manage to regulate so many cellular functions.
The calcium is released selectively -- only when the endoplamastic reticulum is activated -- and thus determines one or other answer from the nucleus.
Afterwards, conducted by transporting molecules, the calcium makes the return trip: again cuts across the pores of the membrane of the network of tubes and remains lodged within until it will be requested once again.
"If it remains free in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm", Maria de F叩tima says, "the calcium will set off a series of chemical reactions that could lead to the death of the cell."
In order to discover the depositories of the calcium, the researchers used proteins that work as fluorescent probes that, through chemical affinity, adhere to the endoplasmatic reticulum.
They only arrived at these conclusions and saw the calcium depositories of the nucleus because they made use of a two photon microscope, which, besides the very high resolution, causes less damage to the cells than using other techniques.
There is very little of this type of equipment in the world -- one of them is in Nathanson's laboratory, with whom the Brazilian researcher began to collaborate some two years ago.
The work that they carried out together does not only suggest alterations in textbooks, in which the nucleus appears with the only space being for the chromosomes.
It will also affect research for medicines -- such as those used against hypertension or in the regeneration of the liver -- whose side effects might be minimized with a measure that acts in a more precise manner on the calcium of the nucleus or on the cytoplasm of the cells.

On the trail of a vaccine
Brazilians sequence the genome of the bacterium that causes leptospirosis and request patents for twenty-four proteins
Marcos Pivetta
Anyone who has read the issue of the 24th of April of the British magazineNature , one of the most influential scientific publications, verified that a team from the Chinese Human Genome Center of Shanghai, had sequenced the complete genome of the Lai strain ofLeptospira interrrogans , the most common of the bacteria that causes leptospirosis in that country.
Transmitted to man by the urine of rats and other animals infected with the pathogen, leptospirosis is considered the most widespread of the zoonoses, the diseasesthat animals transmit to human beings, especially in rural areas with a humid climate.
Carried out by scientists from a developing nation outside of the axis Europe--United States, the work of the Asian group was, without a doubt, of international relevance.
But for the Brazilians the most important news about leptospirosis does not come from the Far East nor arrive via the pages of some publication -- and has been, until now kept in silence.
Working with discretion on a project in competition to the Chinese work, a research team from the Butantan Institute of Sao Paulo, with collaboration from colleagues at the branch of the Osvaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) in the state of Bahia and with S達o Paulo universities, have also terminated the complete sequencing of another lineage ofL.
interrogans , known as serovar Copenhageni, responsible for the majority of human cases of the diseases in Brazil.
Integrated research
In reality, the Brazilian group did more than simply unmask the molecular structure of a pathogen similar to that mapped by the scientists from Shanghai.
They also took a sure step towards strengthening a promising line of research with the goal of developing better forms of prophylaxis and diagnosis of human leptospirosis, the project's main goal.
This is because in February 2002, one year and two months before the Chinese had published their article inNature , the Butantan scientists had requested, in the United States, the patents for twenty four genes -- and their respective proteins -- identified during the work on sequencing and analysis of the genome of serovar Copenhageni, carried out by the AEG, the public network of S達o Paulo laboratories that specialize in genomes concerning agronomy and the environment.
"These proteins could be useful for the development of a vaccine against human leptospirosis (today there is none) or for more efficient tests for the diagnosis of different serological forms of the illness", says Ana Lucia Tabet Oller do Nascimento, from Butantan, the coordinator of the project onL.
interrogans , which was funded by FAPESP.
Such a hypothesis is based on preliminary tests in the laboratory that have shown that this group of twenty four proteins react on contact with the blood serum of people or rats infected with leptospirosis.
The reply to the patent request, whose rights extend to Brazil, should come out next year.
Comparative study
The Butantan researchers have just completed a scientific paper comparing the genomes of the two varieties ofL.
interrogans .
Much of the information on the work, which was submitted to a large international magazine and is awaiting the green light for publication, is still confidential.
However, some general data, results of this comparison, can already be released.
The two genetic sequences show themselves to be almost the same size.
The serovar Lai has almost 4.7 million pairs of bases (the chemical units that make up the genetic code), divided in two circular chromosomes, one large and the other small.
The serovar Copenhageni shows an almost analogous structure, also with two chromosomes, only that they represent around 60,000 fewer pairs of bases than the strain studied by the Asian group.
The greatest difference between the two strains is regarding to their probable number of genes and respective proteins.
In their study, the Chinese counted some 4,727 genes and a similar number of proteins in the serovar Lai.
Working with the serovar Copenhageni, the Brazilians counted around 3,700 genes or proteins.
This is a considerable difference for two genomes apparently so close to each other.
"We do not believe that there are so many more proteins in the Lai in relation to the Copenhageni", declares the biochemist Elizabeth Ang辿lica Leme Martins, from the Butantan Institute, and an assistant on the project.
"By our analysis, this number difference should be a lot lower, around 200 proteins."
Another contribution from the Butantan team, which also was able to count upon the participation of Paulo Lee Ho and Luciana Leite, was the discovery of 250 new proteins on the surface of serovar Copenhageni.
These proteins stay on the membrane of the cells of the pathogen and are in direct contact with the host, man or animal infected byL.
interrogans .
Among this group of proteins, a smaller group of 174 lipoproteins stand out, these could have greater involvement in the process of infection caused by the bacterium.
"Before our work began, only ten lipoproteins had been identified onL.
interrogans ", says Ana Lucia.
"The Chinese described only a few proteins of this type."
In the towns
Differently from serovar Lai, typical of the flooded rice plantations of Asia, the platform for a large part of the occurrence of the illness in China, the Copenhageni strain is the one that is principally responsible for the incidences of human leptospirosis in Brazil, where there have been a little more than 46,000 confirmed cases between 1987 and 2001, with an annual death rate of from 6.5% to 20% of those infected.
Here, instead of being a problem associated with open fields, the illness has a more metropolitan character.
In towns people usually catch the disease in areas without basic sanitation, with accumulated garbage (which attracts rats) and with open sewage, or during the time of the summer floods when the public roads transform themselves into dirty streams and increase the risk of contact with water or earth contaminated with the urine of rats infected by the bacterium.
The sewage rat (Rattus norvegicus ), an inhabitant almost as urban as modern man himself, is the main host for serovar Copenhageni ofL.
interrogans .
Once infected, a person can take from two to thirty days to develop the most common symptoms coming from the presence of the bacterium in his organism: fever, headache, shivers, vomiting, nausea and general ill-feeling.
If it is not treated with antibiotics, normally penicillin or doxycycline, theL.
interrogans can affect the kidneys and liver, and in extreme cases, lead to death.
As its clinical manifestations don't differ much from the symptoms unchained by other known illnesses such as dengue fever, and yellow fever, leptospirosis is often mistaken for other illnesses.
In order to reach at a diagnosis with the minimum degree of confidence, it is necessary to carry out laboratory tests using blood or urine samples from the suspected case.
"At times, even with these examinations, one will not manage to say exactly which serovar is responsible for the infection", Ana Lucia comments.
It may well seem as just a detail to determine the serovar ofL.
To know the variety of the bacterium that unchains the disease in a person helps to prevent the evolution of the infection, since there are strains with varying degrees of aggression, and it is of fundamental importance for the creation of a vaccine against this disease.
This is even truer in the case of this pathogen.
There are more than 250 known serovares ofL.
interrogans , with varying degrees of common characteristics.
All of them are fine and elongated, with a spiral form, without rigid cellular walls.
"It is not possible to distinguish the varieties only by morphology", Elizabeth explains.
The problem is that, if its physical constitution does not change according to the serovar, other parameters are a long way from being always the same or similar in the diverse forms of the bacterium.
The degree of pathogenicity, location of geographic occurrence, most common host and preferential victims (man or other animal such as a dog, cow or rat) can vary considerably in function of the strain ofL.
interrogans .
For example, certain forms of the bacterium ause leptospirosis only in men, others infect only animals and there also exist others that attack both.
The Copenhageni and the Lai are among the most virulent varieties ofL.
interrogans that attack the human being.
In the study of the comparison of the genomes of these two strains, the Butantan researchers believe that they identified two proteins present only in the variety sequenced in Brazil -- and involved in the synthesis of polysaccharides, a type of sugar -- that could facilitate the process of differentiating between the serovares.
"If confirmed, this piece of information could also be important for the understanding of the large antigenic variation of the Leptospirae", forecasta Ana Lucia.
Brazilian variation
The main clinical implication of the large diversity of the pathogens responsible for leptospirosis is the existence of multiple antigens associated with the disease, each one of them literally different from the others.
Any substance recognized by the organism as of external origin or capable of offering danger to it is called an antigen.
To defend against this potential aggressive agent, normally one or more proteins, the immunological system produces specific defenses (antibodies) against the antigen that is threatening it.
In the case of leptospirosis, due to the high number of serovares of the bacteria that causes the illness, to have antibodies against a variety ofL.
interrogans does not necessarily confer protection against the other forms of the pathogen.
In an ideal scenario, the perfect vaccine against leptospirosis would confer immunological protection against all of the forms of the bacterium, or at least those most disseminated.
Nevertheless, the maximum that can be obtained in many cases is a more focused and specific product, capable of impeding the infection brought on by one or another type of serovares and that shows itself innocuous to the other forms of the pathogen.
The countries that are deeply researching into leptospirosis, which are few, tend to focus their work on the most important local varieties.
Besides China and Brazil, that have sequenced distinct varieties ofL.
interrogans , the Australians are studying the genetic material of another strain of this bacterium.
"We have to carry out our very own research with the serovar Copenhageni, which is the major cause of human leptospirosis in Brazil, since nothing guarantees that a vaccine developed abroad, against another variety of the bacterium, will also be useful for us", emphasizes Ana Lucia.
If the clues that the Brazilian researchers have picked up are shown to be correct and everything runs to plan, a form of immunization against the illness could become a reality in five to ten years time.
To speed up the process, partnerships with the pharmaceutical industry and researchers in the veterinary area, who are also interested in new therapies against leptospirosis, are one of the priorities of the group from the Butantan Institute.

Under the Skin
Beauty creams stimulate more brain regions in women with sensitive skin
There is no doubt that the skin of two individuals can react -- and react effectively -- in a different manner to the application of a cream or beauty product.
Some people use enormous quantities of a cosmetic without showing any form of skin irritation.
Others, just after having put the same product on their skin, feel itching or burning at the point where they applied it.
Might looking at what is happening in the brain of individuals with sensitive skin and those with non-sensitive skin, help to better understand the problem?
Perhaps, if one judges by the results of a recent survey.
In collaboration with the National Health and Medical research Institute (Inserm in the Portuguese acronym) and the Bic棚tre Hospital in Paris, researchers with the company L'Oreal, the French multinational in the cosmetics area, have demonstrated that, on entering into contact with substances known to be irritants, women with skin classified as sensitive show a standard of brain activity very different from those who have a skin that is not sensitive.
With the help of images obtained through a technique of functional magnetic resonance, capable of showing which sectors of the brain are activated by a stimulant, the authors of the study realized that the areas activated among women with sensitive skin were in greater number and distributed themselves in a manner more or less uniform between the two hemispheres.
With the participants with non-sensitive skin, the answer was much more discrete and mostly concentrated in the hemisphere opposite the region of the body to where the stimulus has occurred.
"We have the impression that the information (referring to dermal discomfort) arrives at the brain of all women in the same manner, but is dealt with in a different way according to the context, to the sensitivity of the skin", explains the French physicist Bernard Querleux, the main author of the work and L'Oreal's research director, who was in Brazil last month.
Part of this study was presented at the 20th World Conference of Dermatology, which took place in Paris last year.
The brain's responses
In his studies, Querleux and his assistants set out to determine, in an objective manner, the neural bases of sensitive skin.
It is an important line of research for the cosmetics industry, products of which are placed over the epidermis and must beautify their consumers -- and not cause them pain or discomfort.
In Europe and the United States, half of the women, the main consumer public for face creams, have skin that is more susceptible to showing undesirable reactions after the application of a cosmetic.
In China, one third suffer from the same problem.
In other parts of the world, at least 10% of the female population have this characteristic, according to data from L'Oreal, which invests 3% of its yearly revenues (something around half a billion Euros) in their research division.
To have sensitive skin is not a rare condition, but to diagnose the problem is not always easy starting from clinical signs or from biophysical measures.
"This is a theme that still carries with it a large dose of subjectivity", Querleux comments, "hence our interest in studying it."
In order to see how the brain reacts when confronted with a product that is more aggressive to the epidermis, the French researchers carried out an experiment with eighteen women, of whom half said that they had sensitive skin.
On the left hand side of the face they placed droplets of an inert solution and applied to the right lactic acid, a substance normally used as an irritant in tests on dermal reactivity.
During a ten-minute period the magnetic resonance device registered the functioning of the brain of each of the women.
This type of equipment measures changes in the flow of blood and oxygen in the regions where there is a large amount of neuronal activity and generates images in which the brain areas brought into action by the stimulus are highlighted.
At the end of the experiment, even before analyzing the magnetic resonance images, the scientists had already managed to easily separate the women into two groups.
Those who showed greater discomfort on the right face where the lactic acid had been applied made up part of the group previously labeled with sensitive skin.
Those who showed less irritation on this side of their face were in the team of non-sensitive.Up until this point the study appeared to confirm the obvious: those who declared themselves to have sensitive skin suffered more from the effects of the irritant substance.
The work became more original when Querleux and his colleagues went on to evaluate the profile of the brain activation of the two groups of women.
There were some common points and evident differences.
Among the points in common that came up, there was the realization that all of the patients, with or without skin sensitivity, had shown an increase in neuronal activity in the primary sensorial cortex of the left hemisphere of the brain.
Therefore, in the patients whose right face had been exposed to a substance that causes discomfort, the registration of neuronal activity on the left of the cortex was greater than that expected.
In the end, the left hemisphere directs and feels the right side of the body and vice-versa.In the chapter dealing with the differences between the two groups of participants in the study, more interesting data came up.
In spite of the facial irritation having led all of the women to react, in both of the brain hemispheres, at two subdivisions of the cortex (the pre-frontal and cingulate regions) the neuronal activity registered in these subdivisions was much greater in those with sensitive skin, especially in the right side of their brain.
This data led Querleux and his colleagues to think that the pre-frontal and cingulate cortexes could be directly linked to greater sensitivity of the skin.
"We cannot forget that to have sensitive skin is to feel the lowermost level of pain, on a nano-metric scale, because of the application of a cosmetic", says L'Oreal's research director.
"For this reason, the neuronal circuits of sensitive skin can also be looked upon as circuits of pain", Querleux concludes.
Besides studying the neural bases of sensitive skin, the researchers at the cosmetics multinational developed studies destined towards increasing their understanding about touch.
In another study done with the help of functional magnetic resonance, they gathered evidence that neuronal stimulus brought about by the application of a cream in the hand of a woman seems to vary according to a basic trait of her personality.
After making use of the product, the most imaginative bring into intensive action both of the brain hemispheres.
In the case of more objective and logical women, the cerebral activity tends to concentrate in the hemisphere opposite to the hand that received the cosmetic.
For L'Oreal, the study is providing clues about what a cream might do to the most emotive portion of the brain of people, above all those who are most sensitive.

Rich and tragic
Only 2.4% of the natural vegetation of the Minas Gerais Triangle remain, ten times less than the minimum recommended
One of the most productive agricultural regions of the country, the Minas Gerais Triangle is beginning to pay dearly for its robust economic development over the last few decades.
The excessive felling of the natural vegetation, intensified during the 60s by the federal programs to expand agricultural frontiers, is bringing about an effect already felt by the population: a shortage of water is beginning to be felt in the growing areas and in the urban areas of Uberaba, Araguari and Ituiutaba, some of the main cities of this region of sixty four municipalities and 1.7 million inhabitants.
Of this natural vegetation, named Cerrado (wooded savanna), which covered half of Minas Gerais, there remains only 2.4%, ten times less than that required by law, according to a survey coordinated by the geographer Samuel do Carmo Lima, from the Federal University of Uberl但ndia (UFU).
In the 54,000 km2 of one of the most rich regions of Minas Gerais, pasture and monotonous plantations of soya, corn and sugarcane predominate, in the space of the now rare sousari nut trees, sucupiras, paus-terra and other trees of up to ten meters in height, of torturous trunks, thick bark and thorny leaves, notable for their resistance to fire mixed in with the creeping vegetation and grasses.
"There is natural vegetation only in the areas of most inclined relief and in the canyons (deep depressions between the mountains)", Lima explains.
Financed by the Research Support Foundation of Minas Gerais (Fapemig), his survey shows that it is not only in the Triangle that the area of Cerrado is below the limit imposed by law: current Brazilian legislation calls for the conservation of 20% of natural vegetation in rural properties and prohibits the cutting down of the vegetal cover that accompanies rivers and streams, theso-called thorny undergrowths.
In some of the other ten regions analyzed, the Cerrado has practically disappeared -- in the Valley of the Jequitinhonha river, the poorest region of Minas Gerais, there remains 0.09% of this type of vegetation, and in the metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte 0.77%.
In all of the state, the remnants of Cerrado don't go beyond one tenth of what had existed.
"As a consequence of inadequate management and not taking care of the land, we are losing, per year, around one centimeter of the superficial layer, the most fertile of the soil", he says.
"Erosion, besides diminishing productivity, increases the cost of agricultural production."
Cristina Garvil, the director of the Water and Sewage Authority of the town of Ituiutaba, points to another problem: "The rural producers don't have money to fence and reforest the lost area."
The plans
In order to confront these problems, the Association of Municipalities of the Valley of the Parna鱈ba River (Anvap) has created a civil society organization of public interest, the Caiap担nia Institute of Environmental Sanitation.
By luck, even with such a small amount of natural vegetation, the Minas Triangle is one of the regions in the state of Minas Gerais with the largest area of preserved Cerrado -- something that should help considerably in the recovery of the devastated areas.
Lima calculates that 15,000 km2 -- almost one third of the complete Triangle -- needs to be replanted so that the rural properties will exhibit the minimum natural coverage determined by law.
"We're going to spend ten years until more consistent results begin to appear, but I'm confident", he says.
At an estimated cost of R$ 400,000, the reforestation should begin during this year, giving priority to the micro basins that serve as the areas of springs for the provision of water for Uberl但ndia, Uberaba, Araguari, Ituiutaba and Tupaciguara, the main towns in the region.
Wire fencing should be installed in these areas to impede the invasion of cattle and to allow the natural vegetation to regenerate itself, no matter how slowly.
The areas of advanced devastation will demand prolonged work, with the creation of nurseries for the native species before reforestation.
Water table
Begun during the Colonial period, the deforestation of the Minas Triangle has always been linked to the conquest of space for cattle and agriculture.
The felling of the trees intensified, however, at the end of the 50s with the building of Brasilia, and expanded during the following decades with the federal projects for the expansion of the agricultural frontiers towards the north and northwest regions.
"The federal programs for the installation of an infrastructure and the state programs of support to the agricultural business in this region transformed the areas of Cerrado, before seen as sterile, into productive lands", says Eduardo Nunes Guimar達es, from the Economics Department of the Federal University of Uberl但ndia.
Agriculture really advanced -- perhaps too much.
Today there is a lack of water because even the undergrowths that protected the margins of the rivers have disappeared.
Without them, the rivers receive the earth from soil erosion and are becoming shallower.
The problem gets worse because the naked soil retains the water less intensively.
Thus, there is no way of maintaining the subterranean water reserves -- the water table, which maintains the forests, the agricultural lands and the towns.
"The Triangle is still a water tank for the country", emphasizes Lima.
Within it is one of the supplies of the Guarani Aquifer, the underground reservoir that spreads below the Southeast and South of Brazil and through part of Paraguay, Argentina and Uruguay.
"But this reserve is leaking away without a vegetal cover that would secure the reposition of the water."

Inverted flow
After successive occurrences of El Ni単o during the 90s, the Tapaj坦s National Forest now liberates more carbon dioxide gas than it absorbs
Data collected from one of the twelve towers of the Large Scale Biosphere/Atmosphere Experiment in the Amazon (LBA) that measures how much carbon dioxide (CO2 ) -- the main gas responsible for the increase in the greenhouse effect, which is progressively raising the average temperature of the Earth -- comes in and goes out at different points of the ecosystem has shocked researchers.
According to the registers of this tower, situated some fifty-five meter high at a point at the Tapaj坦s National Forest close to the small town of Santar辿m, in Par叩, this stretch of the Amazon launches more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than it absorbs.
This is the first time that an experimental tower, capable of registering ten times per second the concentrations emitted and assimilated of this compound, points to an overall loss of carbon in some parts of the forest.
In the long term, if this behavior persist, this would be equivalent to saying that this point of the forest (and only this one, as far as we know) has contributed to increasing the greenhouse effect -- and not to reducing it, as would appear to be the case with the Amazon in general.
The realization that this stretch of the National Tapaj坦s Forest releases more carbon dioxide than it absorbs was carried out by the American Steven Wofsy, from Harvard University, one of the participants in the LBA, a mega international project of US$ 80 million that, since 1999, has been bringing together more than three hundred researchers from Latin America, Europe and the United States under the leadership of Brazil.
The scientist, nonetheless, avoided making any more general comment about the role of the Amazon basin over the long term in the global balance of carbon dioxide.
"Throughout all of the forest we hope to see various standards, with some areas losing and some areas gaining in carbon", said Wofsy during an interview for the February edition of the magazineEnvironmental Science&Technology .
"In the specific case of the Santar辿m tower, the annual deficit is around a half a ton of carbon per hectare", says Paulo Artaxo, from the Physics Institute of the University of Sao Paulo, one of the LBA coordinators.
The sea and the forest
For Dr. Wofsy, the cause of the unprecedented negative balance in the flow of carbon dioxide measured at the tower in Santar辿m is related to the effects on the regional climate brought about during the last decade by successive El Ni単os, the abnormal warming of the superficial waters of the South Pacific that alters the indices of rainfall and temperature in several spots of the globe.
Because of the four El Ni単os registered during the 90s, there was less rainfall in the region of Tapaj坦s and more trees succumbed to prolonged drought.
With the ending of the effects of this climatic abnormality, the levels of humidity in the Amazon, normally high, returned to their usual levels and accelerated the rotting of a large quantity of tree trunks and vegetables that had not resisted the dry spell.
The result: the rate of decomposition of abundant dead wood became so elevated that the levels of the carbon dioxide release overtook the intake rate by the photosynthesis of the forest.
In spite of the fact that the live part of the forest has responded positively to the re-establishment of the region's high humidity, the growth of healthy trees -- read assimilation of CO2 -- was not as expressive to the point of overcoming the quantity of gas exhaled by the decaying of the leftovers of the vegetation.
The majority of scientists believe that the tropical rainforest is capable of absorbing more CO2 than it emits.
In practical terms, this vision implicitly confers upon Amazonia the role of removing a part of the excess of this gas present in the atmosphere and thus diminishing the increase of the greenhouse effect.
Recent data from almost all of the LBA towers are compatible with this theory.
Nevertheless, the quantity of carbon dioxide naturally assimilated by this ecosystem is, according to the most current measurements, equal to or only marginally greater than that expelled, with an annual positive balance of between 1 and 2 tons of carbon per hectare of the forest -- and not at 6 to 8 tons as previous studies has indicated.
Or that is to say, the cleansing effect of the Amazon on the atmosphere seems to exist, but may well be a lot more modest than had been thought.
Heat impact
This may well be true, but the unusual measurements in the Tapaj坦s National Forest become even more interesting when compared with the results of another recent study, made within an environment similar to that of the Amazon.
In an article published in the May 13th edition of the scientific magazineProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , in the United States, researchers from the University of Missouri suggest that the trees of the tropical forest of La Selva, on the coast of Costa Rica, are growing less and are making their balance of carbon during the hottest periods to be negative, especially during years with a pronounced El Ni単o as during the period 87-88.
After having analyzed the flow of carbon from 1984 to 2000 in La Selva, the authors of the study realized that, when the temperatures get higher than normal, the tree vegetation of the region begins to emit more CO2 than it is absorbing.
As can be seen, if the question is a loss of carbon during an El Ni単o year, the forests of Santar辿m and La Selva appear to exhibit similar behavior.
"In order to calculate the influence of the tropical ecosystem upon the greenhouse effect, measurements need to be taken in other locations and for periods of a much greater time span", Artaxo comments.

The force of vacuum
Team from USP discovers the limits to the use of the Schr旦dinger wave equation, one of those most employed in the study of the atom
Carlos Fioravanti
Son of a physician, Aristotle learnt at an early age to show assurance in all that he said.
Later on, the Greek sage formulated the thesis that nature and a vacuum do not match.
Almost 3,000 years later, though, vacuum has ceased to be a synonym for emptiness and has become an inexhaustible reservoir of energy that can no longer be disregarded.
It is the vacuum that supplies energy to the electrons -- atomic particles with a negative electrical charge -- and keeps them in movement around the atomic nucleus.
Aristotle would be surprised if he knew that, without this energy, objects would not have formed.
There would be nothing besides a soup of electrons and protons -- particles with a positive charge -- that would not successfully organize themselves into atoms.
The physicistsfrom USP found that only Heisenberg's formulation works in a satisfactory way, when the forces of vacuum are considered.
Accordingly, they established the limits for using one of the formulas most used in the study of the behavior of atoms, calledthe Schr旦dinger wave equation -- including vacuum, Schr旦dinger's equation produces an incorrect value for the minimumenergy of the atom.
At the same time, the physicists from S達o Paulo did away with the ancient idea that the two approacheswould always be equivalent, and would lead to the same result about the minimum energy of the atom -- essential informationfor understanding, for example, at what temperature a metal melts.
Students, engineers and physicists are certainly going to like this news, because the equation that indicates correctly theenergy of the atom is Heisenberg's, simpler and easier to work with than the other.
Schr旦dinger's wave equation continuesto be useful, but dealing with it will call for a bit more attention from now on.
So as not to appear pretentious to the point of dethroning one of the founders of quantummechanics, she drew up a more modest version to explain what they had done: "We confirmed what Dirac had suspected".
Solitary particles
Briton Paul Dirac rediscovered vacuum in 1927.
20 years had already passed by since this kind of energy had beenproposed by Germany's Max Planck, the discoverer of the strange world of quantum mechanics, in which atomic particlesacquire apparently absurd behaviors -- being able to be in two places at the same time, or going from one point to anotherwithout passing through the middle.
In 1963, Dirac raised the possibility that the two routes for calculating the minimumenergy of the atom, Heisenberg's and Schr旦dinger's formulations, would not lead to the same result.
Dirac arrived at thisconclusion availing himself of sophisticated calculations, which described the interaction of the electron with theelectromagnetic forces of the vacuum.
His conclusions remained unknown until they were redeemed by the group from USPlast year.
The S達o Paulo physicists arrived at the same result as Dirac with a very simple conceptual model, equivalent to an electron immersed in a vacuum, vibrating on the tip of a spring.
It is the so-called simple harmonic oscillator with an electric charge, the same that can represent the hydrogen atom, with only one electron orbiting around a solitary particle -- a proton -- that constitutes the nucleus.
This model also represents the atoms of another six chemical elements -- lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium and francium -- in whose outermost layer there is just one electron.
Based on this test platform, the researchers assessed, first, the equation created by Heisenberg.
Oddly enough, the mathematical route proposed by the German scientist to find the energy of the electron is similar to the approach adopted 300 years before by British physicist Isaac Newton to define the movement of any body.
Heisenberg and Newton, each in his own way, see acceleration as an effect of force acting on this body and therefore foresee movement, whether of a component of an atomic nucleus, or of a planet.
Newton, in 1687, and Heisenberg, in 1925, consider the position of the particle evolving in time -- a variable abolished in Schr旦dinger's equation, formulated one year later, in 1926.
The physicists from USP added theforces of vacuum to Heisenberg's formula, and without any problem arrived at the correct value for the minimum energy ofthe electron oscillating on the tip of a spring.
Doing the same with Schr旦dinger's formulation , they noted that the energy ofthe electron simply doubled and led to strange situations -- it would be like saying that an ordinary person almost 2 meters tallcan be up to 4 meters in height.
Schr旦dinger's equation only worked without the forces of vacuum -- the maximum height ofthe people went back to be 2 meters.
That is where the practical recommendation comes from: do not add the forces ofvacuum to the Schr旦dinger wave equation.
Except in this situation, vacuum can no longer be disregarded.
The electron itself seems to perceive this kind of energydispersed in space, like a fly soaking itself with humidity before the rain starts to fall.
"The electron emits and absorbsradiation from the vacuum all the time", Fran巽a says.
"And it maintains the orbit stable because it emits the same amount ofenergy as it absorbs."
Although almost imperceptible at room temperature, vacuum acts in a way that is similar to a magneticfield, resulting from the action of a common magnet, and manages to draw together two neutral metallic plates, in parallel andkept at a temperature close to absolute zero (-273o Celsius), as has already been demonstrated experimentally -- it is theCasimir force, identified in 1954.
Even if it is not known as well as electricity, vacuum is more intense than gravity, the most tenuous and all-embracing of the forces that govern the Universe.
The Casimir force becomes 16 times greater if the distance between the two plates falls byhalf, while gravity only multiplies fourfold.
It still remains to be proved, but one imagines that vacuum can be the mysterious dark energy, which corresponds to 73% of the universe.
Straight away, besides explaining the composition of the cosmos, vacuum has become important for representing a usable form of energy, even to replace electricity.
This possibility arose only a few years after the quantum theory had become consistent, as a result of the joint work of a group of notable scientists that included Dirac, Schr旦dinger and Heisenberg.
In 1928, when the phenomena that were to allow the construction of sound and television apparatuses were beginning to be clarified, American Harold Nyquist foresaw that vacuum could interfere with electric circuits.
On the basis of this idea, Fran巽a, from USP, and a team from two American companies, Mission Research and ManyOne Networks, designed a piece of equipment that, if it works out, will successfully extract useful energy from a vacuum.
The apparatus consists of a coil with a diameter of 2 centimeters, cooled down to -270o Celsius, which ought to work like an antenna to capture energy from the vacuum.
"Depending on the way it is wound, the coil, in principle, can cancel out or increase the power for capturing energy from a vacuum", says Fran巽a.
The plan is to set up and test the experiment before the year is out, provided that the problems with the budget are overcome.
The prototype should not work out for less than R$ 150,000.

Simplified disorder
Team from Campinas and the MIT draws up a method that facilitates the calculation of entropy
More than an obscure concept, disorder is a physical quantity that can be measured, in the same way as the length of a pencil.
The apparent confusion that accompanies the prosaic spreading of coffee in a cup of milk is called entropy, nowadays calculated on a computer using at least 20 different approaches.
As these techniques are complicated and laborious, a team from the State University of Campinas (Unicamp) and from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in the United States, created a simpler method that leads to the same results: it is Reversible Scaling (RS), which, according to its authors, goes so far as being 40 times quicker to calculate entropy and the free energy free for great temperature ranges.
Free energy is that portion of energy contained in a physical system that can be converted into useful work -- for example, only a part of the chemical energy contained in a liter of gasoline is transformed into movement in an automobile."The
interest in calculating entropy and free energy is that they also signpost the way by which nature develops spontaneously", says Alex Antonelli, from Unicamp's Physics Institute, one of the authors of the program, jointly made with his former student Maurice de Koning, today at the MIT, and Sidney Yip, one of the pioneers in computer simulation in physical systems, also from the MIT.
In the case of water turning into ice, the free energy of the water is lower for the liquid state than for the solid state, at temperatures higher than 0属 Celsius.
But the situation is inverted at temperatures below this level -- this is the reason why water freezes when cooled down to zero.
"The state of lowest free energy always predominates", says the researcher.
There is also a delicate balance between internal energy and entropy -- in other words, free energy -- that determines the spatial structure of the proteins of any living being.
From cells to the heat of the Earth
The traditional method most used, Thermodynamic Integration, or TI, demands from five to ten simulations at a given temperature to get the entropy or the free energy at this given temperature.
Supported by FAPESP, the recently created RS starts off with a specific temperature, from which one finds out the free energy, andchanges it in a slow, dynamic way, with just one simulation -- that is where the time saving comes from.
"Nobody thought before of adopting this approach, because it was thought that it wouldn't work", says Antonelli.
Dreamt up by Koning, RS was made public in 1999, in an article inPhysical Review Letters .
Adopted by such renowned researchers as chemist William Reinhardt, from University of Washington, it earned a detailed description in December 2001, in theJournal of Chemical Physics .
In January,Nature Materials published a three-page article on this new approach, signed by Yip.
RS is not a computer program, but a public domain method.
For this reason, Antonelli reminds us, each researcher has to adapt it to his specific problems.
For example, a group from Rio Grande do Sul is interested in using this approach to calculate the free energy of the ions (electrically charged atomic particles) that pass through cell membranes.
RS may also be useful in studying the properties of materials, when simulation is the only way.
Recently, with an approach that, according to Antonelli, could be done in ten times less time using RS, and team in Britain estimated the temperature of the liquid iron in the center of the Earth at about 6,500属C.

Plugged into the world
An innovative study shows how dance and body evolved together and both in harmony with technology
D辿bora Crivellaro
A good way to understand contemporary dance is to understand that it wants to be plugged into the world.
In choreographers' work, chance improvisation and common day-to-day movements are present.
The more their work are impregnated into the world, indeed contaminated by it, the better the result.
However, one cannot say that there is no rule, because at least one is followed to the letter: the search for diversity.
As one of the proposals of this movement is to move in the time of society, technology simply cannot be left off the stage.
From the end of the 80s, sensors, cameras and micro filming cameras, videos, holographs, software and specific hardware, laser and scanner, have all entered onto the scene as agents of the spectacle and have represented an esthetic reflex of this evolution.
The first registers of the use of a computer in dance date back to 1964, but there is practically no studies on this theme here in Brazil.
This was the proposal of the choreographer and ballerina Ivani Santana, for her recent doctorate thesis defended at the Communication and Semiotic Department of the Catholic Pontifical University of Sao Paulo (PUC-SP), which with FAPESP's support resulted in the bookCorpo Aberto: Cunningham, Dan巽a e Novas Tecnologias [Open Body: Cunningham, Dance and New Technologies] published by Educ.
The proposal was to understand dance and body as pertaining to the same evolutionary process in a chain link of semiotics.
Thus, it was noted that the new form of dance did not emerge as an isolated fact, grouped within only the artistic universe, nor was one dealing with inaugural estheticism, a form of art created by the extension of new artifacts.
Dance-technology came about starting from the change of the macro system.
The key to assimilating the work of these artists lies in the body itself, one of the instruments used to signal the changes in the universe, since within it indeed are contained many of these transformations.
In order to understand how dance-technology functions, one has to bear in mind that the digital era did not come on the scene as a mere scenic resource.
"One is not dealing with productions that juxtapose various media, this is not collage", Ivani says.
For the author, the creations that make use of this technology only in a scenographic manner do not make up part of her reflections.
The technological resources are agents of the spectacle, as important as the ballerina, the music, and the programmer, and interact with each of them.
Art, science and technology become intertwined.
Software
The book traces a panorama on the use of technology in the digital era.
The first known research in the use of a computer as a scenographic assistant was carried out by Paul Le Vasseur, in 1964, in France, and by Jeanne Beaman, in 1969, in the United States.
From that time onwards, software has been developed for various functions, such as: choreographic notation and composition (a type of choreographic score), research, analysis, creation and the capture of movements, educational assistance programs and computing environments for interference in real time.
The sensors can be placed on any part of the stage -- on the floor, on the walls, on the scenery, and/or on the bodies of the artists.
With all of this available, performances such as that presented inL'Apr辿s-midi d'un Faune , by Marie Chouinard, in Canada, took place.
Dressed with technological apparel, the ballerina Pamela Newell danced between five columns of light and had the opportunity to control them.
There also are more radical works.
In Australia, in the workSculpture of the Stomach , Stelarc literally discussed the question of the body in art.
A very small gadget, used in implants, is swallowed by the artist and captures the image of the interior of the body, showing a light that goes on and off in synchrony with the sound of a bell.
The celebrated ballet dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov used the weight of the four hundred year old tradition of classical ballet to contribute with the spreading of dance-technology.
InHeartbeat: MB , by Christopher Janney and Sara Rudner, he commemorated fifty years on the stage leaving to the audible beating of his heart.
The Palindrome Group from Germany made use of the capture of images to control the environment.
Archived in the computer's memory are inputs that transform themselves into new information, such as music, projection or illumination.
A camera is placed on top and two are available on the wings of the stage to register the height, breadth and depth of the image and to establish a three dimensional image (this system is called the Frame-Grabbing System).
They turn themselves into a powerful sensor, since they perceive what is the trajectory realized by the movement of the body in space and time.
Another example of the sophistication to which these programs can reach is theVery Nervous System , by the Canadian artist David Rokeby, which detects, via a video camera, the presence, the immobility and the velocity of the performer's action.
The captured images from one or two pieces of apparatus are mapped on a pre-defined grid.
Each small square, or any other allowed format, of this grid gives information about the changes that occur -- and the alert is done by way of the alterations of light on each region.
Thebest known program in this medium isLife Forms , used to assist in the creation of choreography.
By way of avatars it is possible to create and simulate movement in space and time.
In this scenario everything is possible.
"The setting of the work is controlled by emergent and experimental technologies", Ivani says.
Team
With so many protagonists on stage, teamwork has become fundamental.
In this type of spectacle creation is divided up both by the choreographer and by the specialists in technology and the dancer, a co-creator in real time, who very often controls the various media on stage, during the presentation.
In order to put the work in harmony, each person must know a little about the work of the others.
The multimedia artist needs to understand dance and the performer also cannot be illiterate in new technologies.
"The creation of dance-technology does not need third party services from other areas, it is in need of true collaborative projects, since the arts work entangled with each other", she adds.
Since 1996, Ivani has been working with the musician Fernando Iazzetta, a researcher into the relationship music-new technologies.
The American choreographer Merce Cunningham makes up part of the book's title because he is one of the people largely responsible for all of this opening up of dance, for the insertion of this art into the contemporary world.
An innovator since the 50s, and author of such phrases as "the dancers work with their bodies and each body is unique", Cunningham, at eighty-three years of age, is active until today.
He created the process of chance, changed the form in which the body is to be worked, decreed that ballerinas could dance on whatever point of space.
And since 1989 has been working within the digital world.
When, in 1994, she took an interest in dance-technology, Ivani did not even have a computer.
At that time, according to her recollections, she had already worked in Australia, in Japan, in the United States.
In Brazil, there was not a single bibliography available, nor study released.
This was one of the reasons for which the author got in touch with the Communications and Semiotics Department of the Catholic Pontifical University of Sao Paulo (PUC-SP).
The practical result of Ivani's work is the spectacle entitledGedanken, Dan巽a Imagem Tecnologia [Gedanken, Dance Image Technology].

Debret
A thesis reveals how Jean-Baptiste Debret wanted, through his work, to trace a biography of Brazil, a country that he had admired with illuminist impetus
Carlos Haag
Close your eyes and create, in your imagination, at the images of Rio during colonial times: I bet they will be like the works of Jean-Baptiste Debret (1768-1848), with his blacks, fountains, tail-coated noblemen and ladies in litter who will come to your head.
"He, contrary to the others, truly loved Brazil and understood it deeply the fifteen years that he spent here.
On being shown the Brazilian customs, he wanted to associate them into a project for the correction of a territory that, according to him, merited being among the greatest of Europe", states Valeria Alves Esteves Lima in her recently defended doctorate thesis at the State University of Campinas (Unicamp),The Picturesque and History Journey of Debret: a New Reading , which had FAPESP's financial support.
In it the researcher reveals that the masterly work of Debret, of images and texts, was the fruit of a personal project by the artist, who intended much more than just to document the country, but to write the "Brazilian biography", based on his illuminist beliefs (inherited from contact with the painter Jacques-Louis David, who was his master) and from a long personal experience of living in the Royal Court and the people of old Rio.
Thus, Debret the historian appears.
"Instead of taking in the images of what he saw as data that illustrated an experience during a journey, Debret elaborated a thinking about Brazil and authenticated its images on speaking to the public through his reflections", Valeria observes.
"Thus, it is not simply a trajectory or a journey that he is describing, but an intellectual project about the march of civilization in Brazil", the professor analyzes.
Or in the words of Debret himself: the progressive march of civilization, as the painter/writer wrote in volume 2 ofA Picturesque and History Journey to Brazil .
A son of Illuminism, for Debret the idea of progress was irreversible; even if the reality before his eyes (and even more clearly before ours, by way of his lithographs) he didn't show the country of the future, but of theold-fashioned world.
"For him, the idea of advancement could harbor periods of stagnation, but they would be overcome and regeneration, which is the process to which he refers and through which Brazil was passing through after the arrival of the Royal Family to Rio", the researcher says.
"It was necessary to illustrate the habits and customs of old fashioned Brazil so that there would be no doubt about the advance of civilization, promoted through the House of Bragan巽a in Brazil."
Even more so because there was a gap between his arrival in the country in 1816 (atforty-eight years of age, a mature and well prepared artist) with the French mission, and his return to France in 1831 (then sixty-three years of age) and the almost eight years in which he carefully dedicated his work.
The professor alerts us to an almost generally forgotten aspect of Debret: the text that accompanies the images ofPicturesque Journey .
"He himself stated that `what one unveils the other complements'.
If the images had an autonomous life, his writing spoke bout a Brazil that had changed since the drafting of those images, of how there had been transformation and progress", Valeria notes.
"Without the text, the image of Brazil that he so lovingly registered would be contrary to what he had intended."
Fundamental detail: In Europe, Debret practically did not alter the watercolors that he painted in the country during his stay.
Once again, the historian appears alongside the artist.
However, a historian somewhat partial and far involved in the theme.
Worried about his Brazilian project, he made a selection of the material, selecting what interested him to prove his vision of the country's future and to further spread his ideas, he transforms his water colors into lithographs, a means of spreading his ideas more cheaply and more widely.
The world needed to know the Brazil that he had loved.
Modern illuminist
But this national love had profound European roots.
Born in Paris in 1768, Debret frequented the Jacques-Louis David studio, where he learned that, in illuminist modernity, the artistic ideal lay in the triad of art, politics and history.
"With David he learned that art needs to attend to the necessities of the moment and that the artist is, in this sense, responsible for the adjustment between art and history", Valeria observes.
"Therefore Debret the historian appears at the moment of the elaboration of the texts and in the organization of the material for publication", she evaluates.
"In this phase, which is that of making explicit his view of Brazil, Debret makes the effort to give to his registrations a historic update that they no longer had and that could jeopardize the desired content of his theme."David
was also one of the pillars of art-testimony of neo-classical esthetics: the artist has to show, whenever possible, that which he had mirrored.
In order to show Marat dead in his bathroom, it is necessary to see him in a bath of blood.
History painted in its moment.
Brazilian reality
This helped to boost even further the career of an artist who had arrived in Brazil to teach the methodology that was dominant in European lands.
During 1826, he transformed himself into the soul of the Fine Arts Academy.
"It was at that point, acquiring a growing knowledge about the problems and reforms of the country, that he gained a very clear vision about the reality of Brazil.
Debret talked with monarchs, ministers, politicians and, at the same time, received students from different parts of the country who told him details of their regions that he did not know, but that he could describe in his book", Valeria explains.
"As well, he was able to count upon the assistance of European travelers, but, contrary to them, he had personal experience that went much further and did not restrict him to a mere description of day to day scenes, but he reflected about them."
Once again the presence of David: what we see in his images is not a copy of reality but a verisimilitude that attests to the presence of the painter at that moment.
There is a subtle complexity in this portrayal almost faithful to the streets and the court, which seems to be moving before our eyes, even after centuries, but, at the same time, is the fruit of a conscious option of the painter, intrinsically linked to that of his projection of a vision of the nation's future.
Diderot, another illuminist, had already called attention to the "libertinism of reason", the thought that wants rational and precision sooner than the ideal.
"The link with reality is only one of the aspects of composition, whose result incorporates a long effort of reflection and a well traced out network of intentions", Valeria says.
Slight disloyalty
From there onwards, there is the slight disloyalty to idealism in his images of the Brazilian Indians, which he hardly saw and whose painting did not fit into the "testimonial" role of David.
"He knew them from reports by others and from visits to museums where he could see artifacts and clothing.
And it was from this urban space that he would go on to take the facts and events that were important to his historic works of art", she says.
"Thus, in his interpretation of the Brazilian population, he practically abandoned the idea of a savage and exotic population.
His evaluation of the Brazilian is not that of an individual marked by a constant and direct relationship with nature."
Indeed, nature only appears as long as it is sensitive to the dominion of man's action, modified and tamed by progress.
His images of the natives are the fruit of his projection: from the start, they appear in their exotic and primitive guise, but, all through the images (and later on in time) he prefers to paint modified Indians-- and, from his point of view "improved" -- through contact with civilization.
When he shows Indian dwellings and artifacts, it is only for the purpose that the reader will feel that this stage has already been overcome by progress.
"According to his reading, civilization was the overcoming of a natural phase that impeded the advance of the innate qualities of the Brazilian.
Hence the urgency to organize his historic past, arranged in volumes of his Journey, in such a manner as to make evident to the European that this inevitable path leads to progress in Brazil", the researcher notes.
"The first volume of theJourney was dedicated to the indigenous population, in a non-civilized state, but at the same time, the point of origin of the civilized population: it is starting from the uncivilized that Debret's illuminist thinking is going to interpret the advance of civilization in Brazil", she adds.
In the end, there is nothing more adequate than to prove, by way of the power of time, the idealism of irreversible progress, even from the worst of starting conditions.
In the same manner, the scenery always disappears when it might jeopardize the reader who wants his images to be held by the European public.
"Nature, the space from which the idea of the Brazilian man was born among the majority of the travelers and interpreters of the country, was for him the dominion of civilized man.
Its richness and its savage and untamed character also served his necessities, whether it be as spaces for growth, or as models for the painting of scenery and history", the researcher observes.
Even in the most exotic and picturesque forest, civilized man is stronger.
Masters and slaves
There is, therefore, in this idealism of progress something retrograded to our modern eyes, an inaudible feeling of respect for those blacks.
"In this country everything goes back to the black slave", Debret writes.
More than ever before, the desire to faithfully reflect in theJourney "the character and the habits of the Brazilians in general" comes up and, in this manner, it would be impossible to look at the black in another perspective that is not that of his supreme importance in the majority of the customs and activities of the colony.
"There is in the iconographic representation of the blacks a physical and moral force that survives the denigrating comments of Debret.
The classical model that is used to picture them, raised them in the eyes of those who view his paintings", the author observes.
For the French painter, concerned about Brazil's future, the mixture of races had a fundamental function, through the union of the physical force of the blacks and the "superior intellect" of the whites.
Thanks as well to him we can perceive the intimacy between masters and slaves in the master home whose consequences were so well described by Gilberto Freyre.
Nevertheless, on the question of slavery, the well intentioned historian fell into a trap of contradictions between his discourse and beliefs and the terrible reality.
"Our imagery of this world gains a comfortable aspect from the water colors of Debret", Valeria says.
Thus, even when painting a slave punished in a realistic manner, text and image harmonize together as part of the greater projection of the illuminist: the scene is heinous and shocking, but the text states that the penalty to which the slave is being submitted on the tree trunk had been within the limits of the law.
The liberalism of Debret raised to the extreme enters into shock with his vision of reality.
"He ends up creating, as a historian, a comfortable idealistic reality, wanting us to believe that we had been faced with a country in formation and that it had been preparing for the future", the researcher concludes.

Back to life
Center takes the activity of legal medicine from the limbo to privilege teaching and research
Neldson Marcolin
The 30th of June of 1999 marked a change in the paradigm of Brazilian legal medicine.
On that date, in the town of Ribeir達o Preto, Sao Paulo State, the Legal Medicine Center (Cemel) started to operate.
The main difference from other centers is the fact that it is installed in a university campus -- in this case that of the University of Sao Paulo (USP) --, along with the Service for the Verification of Deaths in the Interior (SVOI) and the town's Medical-Legal Examinations Center (NPML) was also transferred to the site.
The research carried out at the university is thus extended to the IML (Legal Medical Institute), a rare fact in the history of Brazilian medicine.
The creator of the center, Carmen Cinira Santos Martin, a professor at the Pathology Department of the Medical School, had been fighting for almost eighteen years to take this specialty out of the limbo.
Her interest goes beyond having an improved building other than the decrepit and austere morgue of the town.
"I wanted to improve the teaching of the discipline of forensic medicine and to turn it into something as good as that what exists in the world", Carmen explains.
The edition of the 1st of May ofNature had two pages describing the work being carried out at the Cemel.
The magazine took an interest in this distant center of a developing country when it got to know of the work of Marco Aur辿lio Guimar達es, a young Brazilian researcher at Cemel who took his post-doctorate thesis at Sheffield University in Britain.
Guimar達es extracted DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) from the bone and teeth of old bones, something difficult to manage even for the best laboratories in the world.
Carmen is collecting other fruits of her perseverance.
The Cemel Center is a reference for Brazilian towns and she is constantly invited to give talks at all ends of the country in order to explain how she attained this legal medicine working system.
The model of the center, a building of some 1,200 m2 , which today runs with thirty employees (including those of the IML and the SVOI), also serves as an inspiration for the Public Health System (SUS), which already has ready a minute on the law concerning questions on the verification of the cause of death.
In the following interview, Carmen explains the reason behind this success.
How did the magazineNature discover your work?
-- The researcher Marco Aur辿lio Guimar達es did his post-doctorate phase at Sheffield University in Britain, carrying out examinations on the DNA of bones from European archeological sites.
The results were excellent.
Afterwards he applied the same technique on material sent from Brazil.
The exchange of information between the reporter fromNature , David Adam, and the researcher, resulted in the interest of the magazine in knowing at first hand legal medicine at the Medical School of Ribeir達o Preto, the material from Brazil that had been researched and the person responsible for it.
We are talking about Professor Daniel Mu単oz from the Medicine School of USP in S達o Paulo, who was the first person to be interviewed by the English magazine and who spoke of his work regarding the identification of people who had disappeared during the military regime.
Was the story done here?
-- Marco Aur辿lio returned in December to Ribeir達o Preto and kept exchanging e-mails with the reporter fromNature .
He told him that he had been working at an emergent center of legal medicine, but that our country had immense difficulties in this area.
Then the reporter came here in February and stayed for two days with us, getting to know the location and asking about everything.
How did you come to work at Ribeir達o Preto?
-- I came here for my post-graduate thesis.
I studied medicine at the University of Brasilia, back at the beginning of the 70s.
I completed the course and did my residency in pathology.
Then, during the third year I wanted to quit medicine, as I didn't like having to deal with sick people.
At that point one of my professors said: "OK, go and work with the dead".
I thought it was an excellent idea and during my fourth year I was already starting to train in legal medicine.
Since then, I've never left the area.
When I completed my residency, I wanted to teach, following a family trend.
And I wanted to give lessons on violence, a subject that fascinated me.
I chose Ribeir達o Preto because it ran one of the best post-graduation courses in pathology in Brazil.
In fact, it was not the best, it was the second best.
However the first one, in Salvador, I couldn't enter.
I went there, made my application, but since I was the only candidate during that year I wasn't accepted.
You yourself wanted to have a teaching career in what exactly?
-- In what I could do, which was pathology.
I was a pathologist, but had an interest in forensic medicine.
I chose pathology because it involves working with the body.
It was the only way of learning to deal well with the question, in order to later to apply that learning in questions of violence.
Since there was no master's, doctorate, or medical residency in legal medicine, nor even a short specialization course in the universities, I opted for my post-graduation in pathology.
In truth, I could have applied for entry into the police force, which is where the coroners learn in Brazil, but I didn't want to get myself involved in the Police Academy.
In Ribeir達o Preto, all the professors interviewed me to see if they would accept me as a post-graduate.
I was clear: I stated that I had not enjoyed pathology, but liked legal medicine.
To which they asked: "What then are you doing here?"
But one of them who ended up being my supervisor for my master's and doctorate, Professor Jos辿 Alberto Melo de Oliveira, looked through my r辿sum辿 nd asked: "Wait a minute, you really like legal medicine?"
I confirmed it and he helped me.
I ended up doing my master's and doctorate on questions dealing with legal medicine within the Pathology Department.
Now, so many years afterwards, you intend to set up first forensic pathology course.
How is it going to be?
-- In Brazil, medical residency in functioning legal medicine does not as yet exist.
We intend to make a bridge between pathology and legal medicine at the Medical School here in Ribeir達o Preto, creating a four-year residency course in forensic pathology, which is part of legal medicine.
We're in negotiations with the Pathology Department.
So, the master's and doctorate courses in legal medicine are going to be on forensic pathology, which is none other than part of legal medicine, correct?
I do not want to leave the Pathology Department which is excellent.
It's simply a question of nomenclature, who wants to work, works independently from the name of the specialty.
Why has there always been difficulties in the teaching of legal medicine in Brazil?
-- In the first place, the formation of a legal doctor does not exist.
Any medical doctor, with any background, can today take the course to be a legal doctor.
He takes the course by merely reading theory.
In the Police Academy -- I'm speaking about the State of S達o Paulo --, these candidates are trained during approximately one month.
They have to leave everything, family, other things to do, etc.
Many of them give up.
After this training, they begin their professional activity carrying out examinations in the morgue and looking at body wounds of people who are alive.
What they are learning to do is merely impressionist work?
Only describing what they see, as any other person would do?
-- That's more or less it.
It's not surprising that the quality of legal medicine in Brazil is extremely poor.
It's only good on the occasion when the individual who is doing it is a very good professional through his/her own merit.
The Nina Rodrigues Institute in Salvador, where you yourself wanted to go, is it also the same?
-- It is more or less the same, as it is throughout Brazil.
The difference is that in Salvador there is a more open environment.
Within the building of the Nina Rodrigues Institute I was even inspired to think about things here.
The institute there was better in days gone by.
When it's together it works well.
When it's separated the quality falls through lack of research.
You inspired yourself on what centers in order to create the Medical-Legal Center(Cemel)?
-- Portugal has a model that I consider to be ideal.
But in Brazil, Salvador and Brasilia also have major importance because they are more open.
As a student, one could go to the Medical-Legal Institute and can walk through the building at will.
This was during the military regime.
These things only happened because the university opened up space.
Maria Teresa Pacheco, today a retired professor, allowed the student in Salvador to see legal medicine from the inside and not only in theory.
In Brasilia it was the same thing.
Why is the model for the Cemel different?
-- Because we invited the IML to come to the university and we can work together, mainly in research.
Today we already have four legal medical doctors from Ribeir達o Preto who have concluded or are concluding their post graduation and their research was motivated by the work carried out together.
This is a huge difference.
This was made possible by researchers at the Medical School of Ribeir達o Preto.
Who had the courage to sign a check for R$ 600,000 for the creation of this center was Professor Jos辿 Antunes Rodrigues, who is one of the best researchers that we have, and is an ex-director of the college.
How did this process come about?
-- One day, back in 1996, I spoke to Professor Antunes and told him that I had been at this school for nearly fifteen years and had never taken a student to the mortuary of the IML in Ribeir達o.
And that I never would.
The IML had a terrible room; small extremely ugly and poorly prepared.
Legal medicine already dealt with everything in a sad manner, everything ugly -- ugly for others, for me it is beautiful -- and I could not take a student who had been thinking in taking up another specialty to a place like this.
I wanted to bring students into legal medicine, seduce them with my specialty and not frighten them.
If one was to take them to the mortuary, they would never again wish to know about legal medicine.
I spent eighteen years giving lessons using models.
I even said to them: "If you want to go to the IML in Ribeir達o, you can go, but I'm not going to take you there".
I said to Professor Antunes that I was not going to continue working in that manner, that I was going to do other things, and he ended up by taking over the Cemel project.
Why did Portugal serve as inspiration?
The director cannot have a police career.
One doesn't have the police in the middle, because the coroner is affiliated not to the Secretary of Public Security, but to the Secretary of Justice.
Dealing with magistracy is another level.
He is also a member of Amnesty International.
This model from Portugal is similar to that in the United Kingdom and the United States?
-- I have copied the American model in one sense and the Portuguese model in another.
In terms of administration I copied the Portuguese.
In the United States, the university is not necessarily working hand in hand with the IML.
For example, I know very well the people from Colorado in the United States.
The head of the IML service is not a university professor, but has taken a course in pathology.
There lies the basis for all: he is a pathologist in the first place.
Afterwards he went on to do forensic pathology.
This is the good part of the American, British and Canadian models.
However, the administration of them is not as good as that in Portugal because the IML does not work in conjunction with the university.
Why is the system better when it is headed by a professor?
-- Because of the university.
The professor values research.
But is it not a problem when the best university teams also turn themselves into bureaucratic teams?
-- The professor of legal medicine does not carry out research in this area if he is not aware of what is going on within the IML.
This is the big issue that people do not understand.
In the IMLs there are competent professionals, but if they are not trained in research, they are going to work in a limited manner.
I am together with the IML but I don't run the IML.
Although the administrative post should really be one of value, it is necessary that someone is available to create research groups in locations where there is teaching and assistance and scientific investigation doesn't occur as it should.
Today I run two administrations.
I administer the Cemel because it belongs to USP.
The other administration, temporarily, is that of the Service for the Verification of Deaths in the Interior (SVOI), which is a unit of USP.
Is it an advantage to have your IML colleagues here within?
-- It is because it makes all of our work easier.
It is similar to the model in use by the Americans.
The American does the same thing only with a better base because the doctor that verifies death is the same person who examines violent death.
Does the formation of coroners in Portugal involve the same thing?
-- No, in Portugal it isn't so good.
In the other countries, the formation of the coroner is in forensic pathology.
In Portugal, I have found this large error, or that is to say, the coroner also carries out the verification of death without being a pathologist.
Why was the law of 9th of February of 1998, published by ex-Governor M叩rio Covas, so important for your people?
-- The previous law to this one stated that the coroner was subordinate to the police commissioner.
Who headed the coroner's office was the police.
Governor M叩rio Covas put in the place of the police commissioner a criminal examiner or coroner.
This position, in the Covas law, is that of the Director of Technical Police.
In each administration, there will be a medical or a non-medical investigation.
What is the Public Policies Project, financed by FAPESP, like?
-- This was the second Cemel Project.
The idea is to pass technology and training to the people at the IML of Ribeir達o Preto and those at the SVOI.
When we began the work here daily, the lawyers contested the results on the blood alcohol levels because the methodology was inadequate.
It was at that point that I considered that Bruno Martinis, a very well trained researcher, already developing a project at the Cemel (under FAPESP's Young Investigator program), could take over the toxicology laboratory.
The Public Policies Project, which is entering into its second phase, has as its objective the training of technical people in the participating institutions to take samples for blood alcohol levels, which is the examination most in demand.
There are a few very basic procedures such as, for example, teaching that there are the appropriate receptacles for collecting blood.
Once certified that the training occurs adequately, the proponent institution, which is the Medical School, has the responsibility of transferring the sophisticated technology on the use of chromatography, the equipment that processes the blood sample.
The final hoped for result is the efficiency of the procedures and the certainty of trustworthy results.
Or that is to say, you had a problem of the lack of technology and training?
-- The best piece of equipment in the hands of untrained technicians does not produce results.
When I said that the work is elementary, it is because we had to instruct on how to collect, guard and place in the fridge, etc.
Today the scenario has completely altered and things are much easier.
The project, financed by FAPESP, is important because it is not possible to imagine, in the times during which we are living, that we had still not gotten over these basic problems.
To have good equipment and well-trained technicians is a guarantee for the community.
What is the laboratory project on DNA that is going to function at the Cemel all about?
-- The laboratory will be important when we don't manage to carry out legal dental identification, or via a prosthesis, or by the absence of a limb.
In the region of Ribeir達o Preto it's very common to find bones during the collection of the sugarcane.
The sugarcane field is a place often used to hide bodies because the sugarcane, even when small, easily covers the body, which will then only be discovered when the plant is being harvested.
The laboratory will help when families reclaim the bodies and the common methods of identification are not enough to settle the question.
At that point, the DNA examination of the bones comes into play.
The project is ready, but laboratory equipment is missing.
And this Marco Aur辿lio Guimar達es knows.
Furthermore, he has the legal-medical background.
This is important.
And how can your people help to identify the bones suspected of being those of who disappeared during the military regime and were found in the Dom Bosco Cemetery in S達o Paulo?
-- There isn't just one single method of identification.
Today one only hears of DNA, it seems that only this method exists.
But this is not so.
The easiest method, the best of them all is the legal dental identification.
If you have a worked on dental arch that has amalgams and resins that are registered, then it's easy to identify the bone.
The same thing occurs with prosthesis.
I have had here a few dozen identifications done in this manner.
There is then no way to have any doubt.
It's not possible for a medical surgeon to place a prosthesis in your leg and in mine and for them to be the same, so many are the variables.
We are going to help in this identification by way of the DNA exam when we're asked.
Who finances the Cemel?
Is it USP?
-- USP pays a large part.
This building cost R$ 600,000, paid for by the Medical School in order to have a discipline of legal medicine.
The money comes from USP, but comes out of the budget for the Medical School of Ribeir達o Preto, we don't ask for a special allocation from the university.
In order to pay expenses such as cleaning material, for example, there's another source, also from USP, which is that of the SVOI, a university unit that's housed here because it's coupled to the Pathology Department.
This service has the salary payments for everyone who works here paid by USP and a part by the Secretary of Public Security.
At present the maintenance budget is very small that comes from the SVOI.
Per month there's a total of R$ 4,489.00 to purchase cleaning material and to carry out all of the maintenance at the center.
When we need furniture, or a bricklayer, the school provides.
The IML has never given me any money.
But we arrange other solutions to manage things.
Therefore, so how am I going to purchase a top quality piece of equipment?
I get a loan of that piece of equipment that belongs to the HC.
The maintenance material for the equipment is donated by the IML, who cannot give me the money but can donate the liquid, the x-ray plates, etc.
Summing up everything, I have help from the Hospital da Cl鱈nicas, employees loaned from the Municipal Secretary, from the State Secretary, material from the IML, and with this we mount and maintain the center.
Where does FAPESP come in?
-- The excellent toxicology laboratory, under the responsibility of Bruno Martinis, was mounted thanks to the Young Investigator Program.
We didn't get a cent from the university.
In the laboratory, there's almost R$ 1 million worth of equipment financed totally by FAPESP, if we summed up all that Bruno gained with the project, as well as the Young Investigator grant.
Bruno and Marco Aur辿lio Guimar達es also wrote their master's and doctorate dissertations with grants from the Foundation.
Therefore, without this management it would be much more difficult for the Cemel to function?
-- One always has to look for original solutions.
It may seem curious, but I don't consider myself to be a researcher.
I think I'm a strategist, let's say that.
Of course, I publish papers abroad, guide students in their master's and doctorate degrees, and suggest a good part of the research that is being done here.
But, above all I'm an educator.
I breathed the same air as my mother -- and until her death , she was one of the best educators that I had known.
The bovine functional genome project will widen Brazil's competitive advantage in the international beef market
During 2002, Brazil counted some 183 million head of cattle and moved on to have the largest commercial herd in the world.
This year it is going to take over first place among the beef exporting countries.
With sales forecast at 1.2 million tons, passing ahead of Australia -- whose external sales should not be more than 0.95 million tons since they are suffering from a bad drought -- and the United States -- who have maintained the historic mark of between 1.05 and 1.1 million tons.
This competitive advantage gained by the country should widen with the research results from the Bovine Functional Genome Project, launched on the 7th of May of this year.
The project is going to identify the bovine genes of animals belonging to the Nelore breed, a variety of Zebu (Bos indicus ) -- that make up 80% of the Brazilian cattle herds -- in order to develop products and technologies that will permit overcoming limitations related to growth, quality of meat, health and reproductive efficiency, which still impedes greater competitiveness in the national cattle breeding.
"This is a historic leap for the country", declared the S達o Paulo State Governor, Geraldo Alckmin, present at the launching of the project.
The studies will be undertaken by researchers with the Agronomy and Environment Genomes Program (AEG), at twenty research laboratories.
The project has a budget of US$ 1 million, funded by FAPESP in partnership with the Central Bela Vista de Gen辿tica Bovina (seePesquisa FAPESP magazine, edition No. 87).
"The final objective is to improve the quality of the meat so as to achieve good prices and new markets", says Jovelino Mineiro from Bela Vista .
"Biotechnology opens up a new window of opportunity for the country", emphasizes Jos辿 Fernando Perez, FAPESP's scientific director.
Besides boosting the productivity of the herds and sustaining the outstanding position of Brazil in international beef commerce, the studies on bovine genome are going to allow the country to advance towards the demands of the World Trade Organization (WTO), responsible for establishing the rules for sanitation, genetics and zootechniques.
These rules are based on research developed by countries with the most up-to-date scientific knowledge.
"With the functional genome project, we can anticipate and even establish new rules that guarantee even greater advantages on the world beef market", forecasts the State Secretary for Science, Technology, Economic Development and Tourism, Jo達o Carlos de Souza Meirelles.
A cattle producer himself, the secretary is a qualified observer: he has been the President of the National Council of Cattlemen, of the National Committee for Animal Health, Vice President of the International Meat Secretariat and coordinator of the Forum for the Productivity Chain in the Bovine Cattle Raising for Mercosul, among other positions.
From registers to research
The functional genome study represents an extraordinary advance in bovine research that began last century when the first genealogical registers of the Brazilian herds were established.
"The first necessary piece of information to make any kind of genetic improvement is to know who are the animal's father and mother", comments Ant担nio do Nascimento Rosa, a researcher at the Brazilian Agriculture Research Corporation (Embrapa) Beef Cattle, with its headquarters in the city of Campo Grande, in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul.
The first of these registers, dating back to 1904, was started in the town of Bag辿, in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, and catalogued bulls and cows of European origin (Bos taurus ).
During 1918 a register for the Zebu breed (Bos indicu s) was published by the Rural Society of the Minas Gerais Triangle ( a cattle raising region in the state of Minas Gerais), currently the Brazilian Association of Zebu Breeders (ABCZ); the original breed having come from India.
Starting in the 50s, there began to be carried out in Brazil the so-called Proofs on Weight Gain (PGP in the Portuguese acronym).
"Animals from different herds were brought together in a confined environment or in a closed field and exposed to the same conditions so as to know which animals would gain weight the fastest", tells Rosa.
At this point, the selection of the better animals would take place and they would be used for reproduction.
Classic genetics
In the 60s, the first great official leap forward in Brazilian production was registered with the establishing of the National Program for the Development of Cattle Breeding, when the country developed a cold store cycle and went on to invest in production technologies to improve the sanitary conditions of the slaughter houses.
Ten years afterwards there was the start of classical research into applied quantitative genetics, implemented by the universities, research institutions and associations of cattlemen in order to improve the herds.
These programs had as their objective the production of animals with improved commercial characteristics, or that is to say, animals that put on weight faster, had precocious reproduction and produced a better quality of meat.
"Today, after more than three decades of research, we can say that Brazil is a world center of reference in genetic improvement research", declares Irineu Umberto Packer, from the Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture (Esalq) of the University of Sao Paulo (USP).
The Advanced Center of Technological Research in the Agribusiness of Beef Cattlebelongs to the Zootechnique Institute of the Secretariat of Agriculture of the State of Sao Paulo, one of the pioneers in research towards the reduction of the animal's age for slaughtering, has registered scientific results and excellent practices.
"We can confirm a weight gain in the order of 1% per year, or 3 kilograms, in the selected animals.
With this a young animal of one year of age, weighs close to 60 kilograms more than a similar animal twenty years ago", explains Alexander George Razook, who headed the selection program of Zebu cattle (Nelore, Guzera and Gir) based on the post weaning weight and their effects on food conversion, reproduction and carcass, that started back in 1976.
"This difference is translated in the weight at slaughter and in the carcass", he stated.
Since 1991, researchers at the S達o Paulo State University (Unesp) in the town of Botucatu, have also been carrying out research to accelerate the precocity of the animals.
"In Brazil, cattle take on average three to four years to be ready for slaughtering.
Started in 1999, the project can count upon the participation of the Agrarian Sciences and Veterinary College (FCAV) of Unesp at Jaboticabal, the School of Medicine of USP at Ribeir達o Preto, of Esalq and of the Biosciences Institute of Unesp at Botucatu.
"Now we want to produce a super precocious calf using only animals of the Nelore breed which, it is recognized, are considered late developers.
We have to discover how to accelerate the speed of the growth of bone and muscle tissue of the animal, and for this reason the Bovine Functional Genome Project is going to help us a lot", says the researcher.
The Southeast Embrapa Cattle has also been working to raise the productivity of national cattle raising by way of cross breeding among different breeds, but maintaining the Nelore as the base, explains Maur鱈cio Mello de Alencar.
Five cross breeding systems involving bulls of the Nelore, Canchim, Angus and Simmental breeds along with cows of the Nelore or of high interbreeding of the Nelore, are being evaluated.
The research is part of the thematic projectCross Breeding Strategies, Management and Biotechnique Practices for the Sustained Intensification of the Production of Cattle Meat , also financed by FAPESP.
"It is a project for animal production that involves genetic improvement based on commercial cross-breeding", explains Alencar.
"Our objective is to produce biologically different large calves in order to study their efficiency."
After birth the animals are evaluated in various aspects (genetic, nutrition, reproduction, health and economic) throughout their lives.
The researcher explains that the calves and heifers are produced in different seasons of the year so that it will be possible to study distinct techniques of feeding and managing.
This is a lengthy project whose results should come out next year.
Pasture improvement
Besides the efforts to increase the productivity of the herds, there is also a search on for improving pasture.
"The average animal productivity in the country is of five arrobas (one arroba is equivalent to 15 kilograms) per hectare annually and 1,000 liters of milk per hectare per year.
These numbers can get as high as 58 arrobas and 45,000 liters of milk, respectively, depending on the degree of intensification of use of this pasture", reveals Moacyr Corsi from Esalq, who has been investigating forms of improving Brazilian pasture for some thirty five years and is the coordinator of the thematic projectProperties and Evaluation of Irrigated Pastureland and its Management (Capim) , financed through FAPESP.
The quantity of pasturage depends on an increase of productivity of the fodder plant and of its management.
"In Brazil the average efficiency in the pasture is around 30% to 50%, which means that between 50% and 70% of the fodder produced is lost.
It is possible to raise the level of efficiency to between 70% and 80%", Corsi forecasts.
The increase in production of pasturage might well be achieved through better soil conditions, by the use of liming and the application of fertilizers containing nitrates, potassium and micronutrients.
In twenty years, the birth rate measured by weaning -- generally occurring at nine months into the life of the calf -- has fallen from 72% to 50%; the average age for slaughtering has been reduced from five years to three and a half; and the production from the carcass -- measured by the quantity of meat and bone after the animal has been gutted and its skin removed -- has increased from 190 kilograms to 220 kilograms.
This gain in productivity last year allowed the country to produce 8.2 million tons of meat, to register an internal consumption of 37 kilograms of meat per capita, "one of the highest in the world", according to Meirelles, and to export almost 1 million tons.
It has been this constant increase in productivity of the herds that during 1978 allowed Brazil to invert the inflection of the curve of importing and exporting.
Up until that point, the country had exported beef to Europe, mainly to Great Britain, but imported an even greater amount from the Argentine and Uruguay.
"During 1979 we became net exporters and we began thinking in a strategic manner about Brazilian cattle rearing", the Secretary recalls.
Starting at the beginning of the 80s, the Productivity Chain of Beef Cattle, in the environment of the National Council of Beef Cattle was established.
The Council organized the productivity sectors -- "from the calf to the beef steak, passing through the leather industry", says the Secretary --, started up scientific research, the production of inputs, refrigerated slaughterhouses, the tanneries and the artifact sector and the leather industry.
"Today this conjunction of activities makes up the productivity chain with the largest number of direct jobs in the country: 8.5 million workers", emphasizes Meirelles.
Currently the cattle industry represents two of every three hectares occupied by rural activities, or that is to say, of the 3.8 million square kilometers of the land where agricultural activities are being developed in the country, 2.6 million are dedicated to cattle rearing.
Epic zoo-sanitation improvement
However, to win over the external beef market, Brazil had to declare war on tuberculosis, on brucellosis and above all, the illness that terrorizes cattlemen: foot and mouth disease.
Various countries will not import fresh meat from regions with foot and mouth disease, among them the European Union, which is currently the main importer of Brazilian beef.
Scientific research and official vaccination campaigns against foot and mouth disease today guarantee that 140 million head of cattle, from a total number of 183 million, are raised in zones free of this illness, in a production band that runs from the states of Rio Grande do Sul to Bahia, passing through Tocantins, Mato Grosso and Rondonia.
The expectation is that the illness will be completely eradicated by the year 2005.
Recent research is also promising advances in combating bovine brucellosis, which brings about abortion in cows starting at the fifth month of gestation.
The vaccine most widely used in Brazil is produced starting from live microorganisms but S辿rgio Costa Oliveira, from the Biological Sciences Institute of the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), has developed a DNA vaccine, already successfully applied in mice, which is currently under test with cattle.
"In genetic research we have evolved in a spectacular manner.
From the sanitary point of view the evolution of the Brazilian herds has perhaps been the greatest epic zoo-sanitation improvement in history, when one considers the size of the herds and the dimensions of national territory", commemorates Meirelles.
"We have most definitely left the state of being mere shop assistants."
Impunity and Violence
Researchers verify that the percentage of violent crimes converted into prison punishment of the accused is extremely low
Claudia Izique
The model of Justice that is supposed to protect Brazilians is weakened.
Over the past five years, of the 600,000 crimes registered in sixteen police precincts in the city of Sao Paulo, the indications are that only a small percentage could result in punishment with the imprisonment of the accused.
This is because, of a total of 338,600 crimes, violent and non-violent, analyzed during the period, only 21,800 were the object of a police investigation.
It is estimated, based on data from other studies, that of these investigations, 40% come to be dropped.
If this statistic is confirmed then only 13,100 crimes become formal charges turned over to the Public Attorney for prosecution and listened to by the judicial authority.
"Some will be dismissed through lack of evidence, for example, and possibly something around 5% of the crimes analyzed will result in a prison term ",says S辿rgio Adorno, the coordinator of the Center for Studies of Violence (USP), one of the ten Research, Innovation and Diffusion Centers (Cepids) financed by FAPESP.
"In France for every 20 violent crimes, 19 tend to merit punishment", he compares.
The numbers that are being revealed by the researchIdentification and Measurement of Indices of Penal Impunity are not that surprising.
Another survey, about murders of children and adolescents, carried out in Sao Paulo between 1991 and 1994 and already concluded, revealed rates of the conversion of crime into punishment at only 1.72%.
Certainly, this picture is aggravated by the disorganization and lack of resources of the police to carry out investigations.
"The majority of the crimes are of unknown origin", Adorno observes.
But also they can be related to the profile of the victim or of the aggressor, or to the nature of the crime suspect.
"And it could have to do with obstacles confronted by the defendants having access to penal Justice, including the very guarantee of the right of defense.
Paradoxically, it could even be related to subterfuge procedures, such as an excess of procrastinating resources that delay the application of penalties", Adorno adds.
The result is that impunity helps to sustain crime and also feeds fear.
The research is on course.
It is part of an even broader project being developed by the center, in which the crisis in Brazilian Justice is being evaluated, including through historic studies of policies for public safety implemented in Sao Paulo since 1822 until today, through normative and official documents.
In the case of impunity, the researchers equally based themselves on official statistics, but also had to opt for other methodological procedures.
"In countries with reliable statistics, the flow of the criminal justice system produces statistics through all segments -- police, judicial and in the execution of the sentences --, which allows one to observe the movement of registered crimes, charges and lawsuits and convictions ", he explains.
In Brazil, however, continues Adorno, the available statistics, besides being incomplete, do not allow a follow up.
As a function of the extension and volume of the information, it was necessary to restrict the survey to a single section of the police who coordinates the performance and the activities of the police precincts in the West, Northeast, and South zones of the city, in a total of fourteen police precincts and two specialized police precincts.
Instead of accompanying the general movement of crimes, they turned to the individualized observation of the logs as a way of pursuing their destiny in the interior of the criminal justice system.
"We made a detailed and critical study of the primary police registers, in such a way as to close in on the crimes that effectively interested the observation, or that is to say, homicide, robbery, robbery followed by death, rape, drug trafficking, considered to be violent crimes", he explains.
The first part of the research is practically concluded.
In the second phase, there will be a detailed study of the police inquiries and penal processes.
Risk situation
Since 1987, the Center for Studies of Violence (USP) has been analyzing violence and human rights violations in the country and developing studies on themes such as public safety policies and the participation of the community in the solution of violence.
Currently, it is developing five lines of research among them the projectThe Identification and Measurement of the Rates of Penal Impunity , coordinated by Adorno.
Just like the study on impunity, the major difficulty for the researchers of the other projects, lies in the collection of data.
It is known that in S達o Paulo the homicide rate corresponds to 186.7 deaths for every 100,000 adolescents between the ages of fifteen and nineteen years, and 262.2 deaths for every 100,000 citizens older than twenty-four years, according to statistics for the periods 1995 and 1998, respectively.
But little is known about the perpetrators and very little about the victim, beyond their place of residence and death cause.
The registers of the justice department, the police or of the health system don't throw light about the nature of this violence, don't inform about the group responsible for the homicide, nor even give any hint whether there was a relationship between those involved.
Between 1996 and 2000, for example, while the average rate of homicide for the capital grew from 55.6 per 100,000 inhabitants to 66.9, the district of Jardim Angela had already registered the mark of 116.23 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants.
This disparity was observed in various districts of the city.
The numbers and the geographic distribution of the occurrences suggest that the regions with high rates of homicide were equally those with the highest concentration of poverty.
Based on this data, the researchers from the Center initiated geo-referencing research on the violence.
They verified that it was not the high concentration of the poor population that was responsible for the high murder rates.
The scenario of violence registered high concentrations of adolescents between eleven and fourteen years and between fifteen and nineteen years, a large number of heads of families with less than four years of schooling and/or without income, low level of local employment opportunities, infantile mortality rate higher than average, absence of hospitals in the region, less access to sewage and with highly congested home conditions, that is less privacy, greater tension and competition for space.
Employment is scarce in the areas of high rates of homicide and the alternative for the heads of families is in the informal labor market, with irregular employment, poor remuneration, and subject to periods of prolonged unemployment.
Forced inactivity can increase the tension within the family, alcohol abuse and tends to favor violence.
In fact, in the twenty-four city districts where there are many heads of family without income, studies show that violence increases.
"The institutional links between the population and the authorities are characterized by tension, mutual suspicion and even almost non-existence", says Nancy.
For example, this absence of links shows itself in situations such as a lynching.
"A lynching appears as something that happens on the spur of the moment, but, when the case is investigated, it is possible to state that the population had previously mobilized itself in similar situations, without having obtained the support or protection of the authorities.
"The age bracket between eleven and fourteen years is very exposed to the situation of the most severe type of violence: parents, as well as school, already consider that he or she can live on their own and they end up without any type of supervision", Nancy states.
In the moments when they are becoming adults, these young people end up adopting risky behavior, frequently involving themselves in situations of delinquency, alcoholism, drug use, among others.
Or they become easy targets in conflicts for fruitless motives such, for example, fights with neighbors because of a broken window, loud music etc.
"The problem resides in identifying what social situations are more associated with risk, in such a way that the governments and civil society associations can promote prevention programs", advises Nancy.
Defenseless victims
On identifying the most defenseless victims, researchers from the Cepid began to work in a school in the Jardim Angela district with children between the ages of eleven and fourteen years, in an attempt to develop models for managing conflict.
These meetings were named by the living together forum as "who wants to come, comes", Nancy says.
"We discussed the quality of life, violence, criminality, conflict between men and women, relations with friends during the school break, among other situations, and the advantage of doing things together", she says.
The intention of the researchers is to initiate these young people in the resolution of small conflicts, following a model developed by the Canadian researcher Clifford Shearing to deal with violence in housing estates in Toronto, Canada, and which was adapted to mediate tension in the ghettos of South Africa and in needy communities in the town of Rosario in Argentina.
"When the community begins to settle internal conflicts, it gains much more power to negotiate with the authorities on its situation", Nancy explains.
Before starting the groups, a work proposal was presented to the teachers, the parents and to the students themselves, who visited the headquarters of the Center for Studies of Violence (USP), installed at the University of S達o Paulo (USP).
Besides these teenagers, the researchers also worked through living together forums with adults and the graffitists of the region.
"The people didn't see themselves as a community, partly because of the day to day violence and of their economic needs", Nancy explained.
The graffiti writers, in fact, helped in the consolidation of the groups of adolescents that were rejected by the other students in the school.
"The graffiti writers are respected and this gives them prestige", the researcher explained.
The expectation is that, if they learn to deal with incidents of personal violence, they will be stronger to negotiate with the authorities.The
Center has also implanted violence observatories in four communities, in order to debate the problem from the perspective of the victims.
And is also developing five educational projects having violence as their central theme, directed towards pedagogical guidance counselors within the municipal and state teaching networks, among others, as well as a distance learning project in partnership with the Future School.
"Now we are training a team from Mozambique, in collaboration with the World Health Organization, in an inter-ministerial project that brings together programs on epidemiological vigilance, prevention and evaluation of violence."

Risky algorithm
Project in public policy measures situations of violence of the S達o Paulo population
The vast majority of acts of violence that result in injuries caused by firearms in the city of S達o Paulo occur at the weekends, mainly on Saturdays.
Sexual aggressions towards women are more frequent during the weekdays, with their peak being on Thursdays, when they are a long way from the family, going to work, to school or shopping.
The average age of the victims is thirty years.
"With a little investment it is possible to develop and implement a system of monitoring capable of capturing the information regarding violent incidents and the most common accidents", says Paulo Saldiva, a professor at the Medical School of the University of S達o Paulo (USP) and the coordinator of the projectEpidemiology of the Violent Criminal in the City of Sao Paulo: A Study on the Macro and Micro Scales , developed in partnership with the Municipal Secretary of Health, the Secretary of Prison Administration and the Mathematics and Statistics Institute of USP, under the umbrella of the Public Policies Program funded by FAPESP.
Saldiva, a specialist in the study of the effects of atmospheric pollution on human health, decided to make use of the criteria of epidemiological research to study violence, using statistics for risk assessment.
"Violence, different from pollution, is not homogeneously distributed.
It is necessary to take into account variables of time and space and to create new theoretical techniques to assess risk", he recognizes.
The studies, the same as had happened with the researchers from the Center for Studies of Violence (USP) (see material on page20 ), got bogged down in the difficulties of collecting reliable data in the official organs of public security.
The option chosen was to collect information about the theme within the health system.
In the case of the data from the Saboya Hospital, "in spite of the efforts and dedication of the Center for Attention to Violence Victims", he emphasizes, the analysis of the data was made difficult by the lack of standardization of some important variables.
For example, the researchers had to generate some variables such as the classification ofthe occurrence, taking as a base the information registered in the reason for registration of the complaint and the description of the occurrence.
"The quality of the information is an essential item in whatever research study", he observes.
In order to define the classification of the occurrence, the researchers fell back on the International Classification of Diseases, frequency of determined occurrences and specific interests of others, in order to reach the following main categories: accidents, aggressions, legal interventions, medical and surgical complications and events of ignored intention.
The aggressions were classified into self-aggression, sexual aggression, other types of aggression using a firearm, with the use of other bruising instruments, and other aggressions with the use of physical force or non-specified.Standardized and classified, the registers revealed precious information.
For example, they indicate that men and women show similar distributions in relation to the age of the victim at the moment of registering the occurrence, a tendency for a drop of violence in the months of January to July, followed by a continuous increase from August to December, and the prevalence of victims of the female sex during this period.
In the distribution of the occurrences by age groups and location of the fact, the researchers observed a greater frequency between sixteen and sixty five -ears (9.2%) in violence registered in the work location and a greater incidence of victims in the one to five years age bracket when the aggression occurred in the home itself.
In the other occurrence locations -- commerce and services areas, public streets and roads, in someone else's home, not informed and others --, the distribution of the cases was similar in all of the age groups.
Promiscuity and violence
Saldiva's team also collected data about violence from the Coordination of Prison Health System (Cosaspe in the Portuguese acronym), which brings together all of the records related to hospital attention given to inmates in the city of S達o Paulo.
"Cosaspe did not have any computerized information.
Thus the first stage of the work was to develop, in partnership with the Secretary of Prison Administration, the structure of a data bank to make a beginning in digital records and then make an analysis of them", says Liliam Pereira de Lima, the statistician who participated in the project.
Here also the data was revealing.
Violence in the prisons shows itself in the form of illnesses: HIV and tuberculosis, with occurrence of 67.5% and 35.1% respectively in the patients detained in the Hospital Center of the Carandiru Prison, where a large part of the cases of illness and violence occur in the S達o Paulo penitentiary system.
Gun wounds did not surpass 5.2%, and those with a side arm, 1.3%.
In both cases, the victims were sent to the hospital by the Secretary of Public Security, responsible for attending to the wounded in the police precincts.
These aggressions, nevertheless, could have occurred as the moment of arrest.
Violence, in the case of the penitentiary system fails to control contagious infectious diseases.
"The prisons are unhealthy and the prisoners live in promiscuity", emphasizes Saldiva.
"The solution is in the reduction of the possibility of contagion and in the distribution dispensing medicines to control these diseases", he adds.
Risk Algorithms
Having concluded the diagnosis, the research project is now entering into the second phase.
"We are going to propose to the penitentiary system a codification for the data and the management of the information based on logical criteria", Saldiva says.
In the area of health, the proposal will be to implement a unified system for the completion of critical information that will feed a data bank on violence in the city.
"Qualified information, for example, will allow us to discover the cost of violence related to medical procedures, the number of lost working hours, among other information relevant to implementation of public policies", Saldiva says.
This data will allow the elaboration of a geo-referenced map in the study of morbidity.
However, Saldiva wants to go further with his project and reach an algorithm on risk calculation that could be translated into an alert to society: a woman, walking alone, in the region of such and such a street during the period of X hours until Y hours, has a high percentage of risk to becoming a victim of sexual violence.

Unicamp invests in innovation
Inovacamp is going to evaluate the demands of the private sector in order to direct research
On the 15th of May, the State University of Campinas (Unicamp) launched the Innovation Agency of Unicamp (Inovacamp), coordinated by Carlos Am辿rico Pacheco, a professor at the Economics Institute and ex-executive secretary of the Ministry of Science and Technology (MCT).
The first step is carrying of a study to define how this park will be and what type of the industrial segment it pretends to attract.
"The information technology companies will most certainly be present because Campinas already has various companies in this area, but we could also bring in the newly born sector of biotechnology", Pacheco says.
Unicamp received R$ 2.8 million from the Financier of Studies and Projects (Finep) to carry out the study that will be completed in one year.
An important role for Inovacamp will be improving the relationships with strategic partners, such as Petrobras and Embraer, who have already developed various research projects with Unicamp without a central coordination to lay out a long term work plan.
"Today, for example, we can have two or three pieces of research happening in parallel within two or three Petrobras departments without there being any integration between them", Pacheco explains.
In order to attend to strategic partnerships, Inovacamp will have a specialized technical body that will do the mediation between the company and the researchers, centralizing all of the information about the ongoing research projects.
Thus, the intention is to understand the strategy of the company's performance and make it fully realize what Unicamp has to offer.
According to Pacheco, the important thing is that with this information the group of technicians can define what will have to be done in the long term.
The Agency will strive to facilitate the access of researchers to sources of funding.
Product registration
One of the ways to identify the type of research that better attends to the needs of the private sector is the carrying out analysis of some areas, identifying directions, tendencies and challenges.
The idea is not necessarily to increase the number of partnerships, which is already large, but mainly to anticipate theneeds.
Unicamp was responsible for eighty-eight of the two hundred and thirty four patents registered by public research institutions between 1997 and 2000.
The challenge now is to turn these registered patents into products.
"Today a patent is merely a cost.
We want to transform it into a technology license", he explains.
For Pacheco, this is a favorable moment for initiatives that will attempt to facilitate the relationship of universities with the public and private sectors as there is a national conscience about the importance of technological innovation for the development of Brazil.

Cautious optimism
For , it is time for Brazil to transform its power of research into economic advantage
If six months in command of the country have not been enough time for President Luiz In叩cio Lula da Silva to promote deep changes in the national scientific policy, the first steps in the new federal government in the area of science and technology, though still far from having pleased everyone, have managed to inspire a courageous editorial and articles in the issue of the 22nd of May of the British magazineNature , one of the most respected scientific publications.
In the editorial, the publication states that President Lula da Silva, originating from a left-wing party (PT -- the acronym in Portuguese for Workers' Party), has been impressive in dealing with the Brazilian economy, the target of a large part of the initial attention of the new administration.
It assures that, in spite of its social and educational problems, the country can count on lots of "young talent" willing to carry out science and graduates more than 6,000 doctors per year.
"Brazilian science has already proven that it can compete in the international arena with the publication during 2000 of the complete sequencing of the genome of the pathogen of citrus bacteriumXylella fastidiosa ", wrote David Adams, when referring to the project financed by FAPESP.
The Amazon Vigilance System (Sivam) was also described as the "most ambitious of its type in the world".
After having interviewed and written about some of the Brazilian scientists in their journalistic articles, the magazine prints that "there is a widespread mood of cautious optimism" about the actions of the new federal government in the area of science and technology.
And then exemplifies: during 2003, in a difficult year for the Brazilian economy, the federal budget for S&T appears, up until now, to have escaped cuts; the Lula government has promised to double the annual budget for research and development by the end of its administration; and they have recruited good personnel into the ministry and the federal research development agencies.
From what one can gather from Adam's article, the adjective cautious comes from the reactions, not very positively expressed, at the start of the year by the national scientific community on the announcement of the name of Roberto Amaral for the post of Minister of Science .
"The objectives can be praised, but moderation is really needed: President Lula da Silva will limit the potential of his country if he disseminates initiatives in a very wide manner throughout the national territory."
Greater weight
For the magazine, the situation in the state of S達o Paulo, by far the heavyweight in the production of Brazilian science, cannot be reproduced at the national level not even in the medium term taking into consideration that, in the words of the publication, some states have only rudimentary scientific base.
"So S達o Paulo stands out not only because of its commitment with the public university and the funding of science, but also for its strategic approach towards science and technology.
This includes creating conditions that favor the launching of high technology companies, attracting industrial investment from abroad and giving support to research centers that are going to bring in not only science of high quality but also stimulate new commercial companies", says the editorial inNature .
According to FAPESP's scientific director, Jos辿 Fernando Perez, the British magazine recognizes the efforts made by Brazil and by the state of S達o Paulo towards the development of science and technology and is pointing to the need to democratize the national research system.
"Nevertheless, the expansion of the system cannot be done through sacrificing the centers of excellence", Perez emphasized.
Researchers look for support to found a Neuroscience Institute in Natal
Brazil has to lose its inhibitions and inferiority complex and turn itself into a production agent of science of top quality, capable of yearning to win a Nobel Prize.
This is a dream that is driving the neuroscientist Miguel Nicolelis, a forty-two year old Paulista (Born in S達o Paulo) who has been doing research in the United States for the last fifteen years.
Together with two other Brazilian neuroscientist -- Sidarta Ribeiro, thirty two years of age, and Cl叩udio Mello, thirty nine years of age --, he is cuddling an ambitious project: to transform the city of Natal, in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, into the capital of national neuroscience, beginning with the founding of an international institute capable of attracting researchers from the country and abroad.
"There is a very high exodus of scientists and we believe that the political moment, with the election of President Lu鱈s In叩cio Lula da Silva, is favorable", Nicolelis, professor of neurobiology and biomedical engineer at Duke University in North Carolina, points out.
The project even forecasts the construction of a free teaching center capable of giving training of the highest caliber to between 300 to 500 children.
"The idea is to place emphasis on the sciences, languages and creativity", Nicolelis says.
The two initiatives -- above all that of the founding of the school -- can already count upon the support of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN).
"These children are going to work and study with people who are at the top in science, which in themedium- term will give an incalculable return to society", celebrates the pro-rector of post graduate research at the UFRN, Nilson Sena de Almeida.
"There will be attention paid to the highly talented children as well as those with learning difficulties.
It's a brilliant idea, a new model", says the pro-rector enthusiastically.
Collective work
Ways to make the project viable -- whose installations should be ready in three years and fully functioning in at the maximum five, according to Nicolelis's project -- are being studied.
The possibility that it can contribute to the decentralization of scientific production may attract resources from the Ministry of Science and Technology (MCT).
"And democratizing is a way to attract the foreign scientist", adds Nicolelis.
As a matter of fact, the MCT has already made its first moves.
"The National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) is going to participate with grants and the Ministry will open up a competition for getting the researchers in place.
This is collective work", says the Secretary of Policies and Programs in Science and Technology at the Ministry, Gilberto S叩.
But the idea is not to just rely on the support of the government, but also on business and international foundations.
"The Max Planck Institute in Germany has already signaled its intention of placing resources in the project", forwards Almeida.
Nicolelis said to that Hannah Hoag, of the magazineNature (see story on page 27), says that the group will need some US$ 20 million to build and equip the institute.
He also said well that the team plans to manage these resources by way of a non-profit organization that, when established, will be called Alberto Santos-Dumont.
Up until now, the project can count upon US$ 50,000 obtained by private donations.
These resources will be eaten up in the funding of an international conference on neuroscience, sponsored by Duke University in partnership with the UFRN, which will take place in Natal, in March of 2004.
Among others, the event has the confirmed presence of Torsten Wiesel, the President Emeritus of the Rockefeller University in New York, a laureate and winner of the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 1981.
Nicolis guaranteed toNature that Wiesel agreed to be a member of the Institute's Board, as well as the neuroscientist Jon Kaas from the Vanderbilt University in Nashville.
"The Secretary for Tourism of Rio Grande do Norte, Haroldo Azevedo, guarantees that the state government will give all its support to the project and is negotiating the donation of land close to Barreira do Inferno, which belongs to the Brazilian Air Force.
"The location would be ideal because it's close to the UFRN campus, it's of easy access, is sited in a preservation area and is close to the beach."
Nicolelis and his group of friends made their plans and ideas public on the 6th of May in an article published in the newspaperFolha de S.Paulo .
Isaac Roitman, the evaluations director at the Coordination of Training of Personnel of Higher Level (Capes) has already joined the cause.
"These are young people who chose Natal for a number of reasons among which is that they believe that there must be a more homogenous regional distribution of science."
Roitman emphasizes that the UFRN is a fine option because it can count upon an important center of primatology and is an area strong in psychopharmacology.
Claudio Mello, another of Nicolelis's partners, has been working in the United States for fifteen years where he is a researcher at the Neurology Institute of the Oregon Health and Science University.
A Ph.D. in neurology and a specialist in learning and memory, Mello considers the proposal of a center of excellence unbound to an academic structure, along way from the Rio-S達o Paulo and where research of high quality can be carried our, to be seductive.
The third partner is the neuroscientist Sidarta Ribeiro, who has lived for eight years in the United States and is working beside Nicolelis at Duke University, studying the formation of memory during sleep.
Of recognized talent outside of Brazil, Ribeiro would not hesitate in leaving it all behind.
"Brazil is passing through a very positive change and now is the hour to return and contribute."
The army of Brancaleone
Director Roitman says that Capes is assisting the research group in negotiations with the UFRN, development agencies, the CNPq and Finep.
The first contact with the university's administrative board, local researchers and the State Governor, Wilma de Faria, demonstrated the fine receptivity of the project.
"We are in need of, for the academic community throughout the country, a culture of donating.
And at this point enters the line of convincing the Brazilian aristocracy and of the proposal of establishing a law that could guarantee some tax breaks in as incentive to projects."
The Governor has still not confirmed the possible donation of the land, but says that she has spoken about it with the Minister of Science and Technology, Roberto Amaral, to demonstrate the intention of the State to receive the neurosciences center.
"I have requested all institutions of Rio Grande do Norte to push forward so that this wish becomes a reality."
The Governor guarantees that her government will participate in the investment for the installations and in the concession of research grants.
"The founding of the institute will be a revolution for the state", she evaluates.
"Beating once again "
In the end, we opted for a solution away from music, but one of these beautiful phrases insistently remained with us in the days that followed.
They are the opening lines of a touching samba song,As Rosas N達o Falam (Roses Don't Speak) It says: "Beating once again with hope within my heart..." It matters little that from the song comes some shreds of the pangs of love without hope of becoming a real relationship, because what remains from the emotional atmosphere of the song are its positive palpitations.
I believe that it was the word hope, or its combination with the heart, which weighed more for this good and prolonged intrusion of the samba in the difficulties involved with the finishing of this issue.
Because, if above all, it is scientific competency that the story shows when it demonstrates the experiments by the groups from Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and Bahia using stem cells for the recovery of the cardiac muscle affected by cardiac insufficiency coming from different cardiac illnesses -- with promising results --, it is also about hope that the text speaks.
The hope, for example, of prolonging life, with quality, for patients who up until this point had in a heart transplant the only alternative for survival.
As yet in the experimental phase, the little invasive transplant of stem cells, related by Ricardo Zorzetto, assistant science editor (page 34), is a beautiful promise against chronic cardiac insufficiency brought on by hypertension, obstruction of the coronary artery and Chagas's disease.
It is in the vast and not always fully understood field of genomic research that the Brazilian researchers are waging this fine war in favor of the heart.
And when speaking about genomic research, the report about the conclusion of the genome project of the bacteriumLeptospirosis interrogans (page 42) by S達o Paulo researchers with collaboration from their colleagues in the state of Bahia, also merits highlighting.
In this text our special reporter Marcos Pivetta, after recalling that a team from the Chinese Human Genome Center had concluded a little beforehand the sequencing of another variety of the bacterium, the Lai, relates that the Brazilian group, as well as unmasking the molecular structure of the variety Copenhageni, that responsible for the majority of cases of human leptospirosis in Brazil, have requested in the United States, the patents for twenty four genes and their respective proteins, which could be useful for the development of both a vaccine and more efficient diagnostic tests.
In Technology, we highlight the report by the editor Marcos de Oliveira (page 62) about the Genius Institute of Technology in the city of Manaus, which is pursuing innovations in the areas of electronic equipment, telecommunications and multimedia.
Founded by Gradiente, bringing together ninety researchers from fourteen Brazilian States, in a short period of time the institute has accumulated conquests and is preparing itself to widen its base, beginning with a branch in Campinas.
And finally, a demonstration of Brazilian contradictions on the pages of the magazine, illuminated by the activity of research: on the one side, starting on page 20, the editor Claudia Izique relates the results of the work of the Studies Center on Violence among which: of the more than 600,000 violent crimes registered in sixteen police precincts in the city of S達o Paulo over the last five years, only something around 5% have resulted in punishment.
On the exact opposite, on page 27, we have the editorial news and reporting of the edition of the 22nd of May of the magazineNature in which, among words of explicit recognition of the dynamism exhibited by sectors of Brazilian science, the magazine suggests to President Lula da Silva that he grasps the opportunity of transforming the force of Brazilian research in the physical and biological sciences into economic advantage.

Genius Innovations
Private technology institute generates products, seeks independence, and starts to set up a branch in Campinas
Marcos de Oliveira, from Manaus
In a short time, it has accumulated a series of conquests, with the creation of a new type of karaoke that uses an unprecedented way of assessing the performance of the user, a set of solutions for voice recognition in Portuguese, as well as various software and electronic circuits for mobile telephony and DVD and digital TV equipment.
They are results achieved in an experience that is unique in Brazil.
In a couple of years, the institute has been capable of attracting 90 researchers from 14 Brazilian states and from seven countries.
There are 13 doctors, 65 with a master's degree awarded or studying for one, and 12 graduates.
A gathering of competencies that wants to be in the front line of technological development in the areas that the institute has embraced.
Now, with its model for work consolidated, Genius wants to become increasingly independent of Gradiente, the company that created it, and is expanding its bases.
Today, Gradiente no longer makes cell phones and has no more rights to the corresponding incentives of the Information Technology Law, so that it is treated like any other company by Genius.
The institute is modifying a remaining link with the founder, which has a majority interest in the company's capital and on its board.
"The present one is made up of five Gradiente employees.
We are in a process of change, so that there will just be a minority interest", Vianna explains.
"Our annual income is made up of funds for projects approved by the Telecommunications Technological Development Fund (Funttel) and by the Information Technology Sectorial Fund (CT-Info) and, in particular, by contracts with companies for licensing or for developing new products or solutions."
The biggest customer still is Gradiente, which at the beginning of next year should launch the first DVD player with totally Brazilian technology.
Up until now, the company, like the others, imports kits and assembles the devices in Manaus.
Now, it is going to stop buying these kits and start negotiating the components, like chips and other supplies, with the international suppliers.
"To arrive at this point, researchers from Genius have developed the software for the devices; part of the technology was absorbed from South Korea, where the group spent three months. We mastered the technology, and, today, we are talking with American companies that are looking to us for other developments", explains Alexandre Lisboa, a manager of the business unit.
The first innovation by Genius was the automatic assessor for karaoke apparatuses, which gives marks according to the person's being in tune, loudness and rhythm, in a way that is well ahead of others in the market.
"We put into the apparatus's software algorithms for parameters of these characteristics", says Vianna.
Licensed to Gradiente, which is calling it DVD Ok棚, the new system attracted the attention of five companies from Japan and Singapore that have now begun negotiations with the institute.
To make a complete prototype, Genius owns prototyping machinery to produce the outer casings of the electronic apparatuses.
With the DVD player and the karaoke on the market, although it is premature to claim that there is an industrial recovery, there is a return to a path interrupted with the import of electronic equipment at the beginning of the 1990s.
It was a period in which the Brazilian companies that were developing electronic appliances (TV, audio, etc.), like Gradiente and Sharp, for example, had to reduce or to eliminate their research and development teams and start importing products under license, because they did not have the economic conditions and the techniques to compete with imported products.
The times are certainly different, and nowadays from 80% to 85% of a project for electronic equipment goes on the development of the chip.
That is why Genius has eight people trained in chip design.
This way, the institute gains competitiveness and places itself in the global marketing such a way that it now attracts multinationals.
One of Genius's major areas of business is cell phones.
"It is a world-wide contract, and Siemens has already asked for it to be expanded."
Besides Gradiente and Siemens, other large companies have now availed themselves of the knowledge generated by Genius.
The area of voice recognition in Portuguese is one of those that have called most attention.
The development of this system has gathered together 30 persons at the institute and is the group with the largest number of researchers.
It is made up of engineers and linguists who have recorded the speech Brazilians from 250 cities, capturing ways of speaking that total over a thousand voice samples.
All this material is being processed and put into software.
Voice recognition may be used in remote controls, a voice portal on the Internet, service centers and air conditioning apparatuses.
One of the companies to use voice recognition experimentally was Deca, a manufacturer of bathroom metals and fixtures.
They used this system to displayin an experimental manner, at the International Fair of the Construction Industry (Feicon), held in S達o Paulo in April, an intelligent bathroom that answers commands to switch the light on and off, as well as switching the shower on and opening the faucets.
At the 2002 Automobile Saloon, General Motors showed a Vectra model adapted to receiving spoken instructions.
Functions like locking doors, switching on the headlights, switching on the radio, the left or right indicator, were carried out with spoken commands.
In this experiment, the installation of the system in the car was handled by professors and students from the Faculty of Industrial Engineering (FEI), in S達o Bernardo do Campo (SP).
Partnerships with universities and other research institutes are a priority for Genius.
"It is one of our goals to facilitate the drawing together of the knowledge generated in the universities with the private sector.
"We want to increase our interaction with universities", says Vianna.
This approach originally began with the Federal University of Amazonas (Ufam).
Many professionals coming from this university were hired, although there was a lack of courses for Genius's researchers from other cities to be able to carry on their studies, as was the case of dozens of people coming from S達o Paulo, Bahia, Minas Gerais, Paran叩, Rio Grande Sul and Para鱈ba.
"There wasn't any course in information technology for a master's degree in the whole of the northern region", says Vianna.
"So then we proposed the creation of this course at Ufam, where some doctors who work at Genius give lessons and supervise theses", Bergerman says.
Forming the team
Genius's human resources are a separate chapter.
Taking to humid, hot and distant Manaus doctors, masters and graduates from other parts of the country, concentrated in the southern and southeastern regions, could have been a difficulty, but it wasn't.
The challenge of carrying out research and development in an innovative way weighed heavily in the decisions of those invited.Only 30% of the members of Genius's staff are from Manaus, and, even so, a large portion is established in the administrative area.
Amongst the locals from Manaus are physicist F叩bio Santos, a Ufam graduate; Agemilson Pimentel, who did electrical engineering at the Amazonas State University (UEA); and Jacqueline Aguiar, a recent graduate from the Law course at Ufam.
Santos, another recent graduate, who works in the area of applications for cell phones, says that working at Genius is a unique opportunity for doing technological research in Manaus.
For Pimentel, it was a change of course within the same area.
He used to work in the Sony factory in Manaus and accepted the challenge of the new proposal.
As a lawyer, Jacqueline says that the industrial park, where Genius is installed, does not offer any great attraction.
Family and friends were even surprised that she had accepted working at Genius, instead of a job with the Public Prosecutor's Office of the State.
"I enjoyed working in a non-profit organization."
Daniel Gustavo is one of them.
Born inS達o Paulo, aged 29, he worked in two telecommunications companies in S達o Paulo.
With the privatization of telecommunications, Vianna was a director of operations for Vesper and for Telemar.
"I have always sought technological innovation, and now I have the opportunity for leading this team, which surprises me every day, working with a high technological content."

Rubber Medicine
Material made from the latex of the rubber tree closes ulcers and rebuilds the esophagus and the eardrum
Dinorah Ereno
The latex extracted from the rubber tree, the raw material, which during the 19th century placed Brazil as the major world exporter of rubber, is the basis of an innovative biomaterial with excellent results for the healing of chronic ulcers and in the reconstruction of perforated esophagi and eardrums.
Developed at the School of Medicine in the town of Ribeir達o Preto (FMRP), part of the University of S達o Paulo (USP), the biopolymer should initially be produced by the company Pele Nova Biotecnologia, in a pilot plant installed in the city of Campo Grande, in the state of Mato Grosso.
The company was founded by the Brazilian Academy for Advanced Studies, anon-government organization (ONG) maintained by the company Avamax Biotecnologia, which has amongst its members the ex-president of Embraer and Varig, Ozires Silva.
"We make the connection between scientists and investors by showing products with a potential for fighting for a place in the market", Ozires explained, who has already promoted various meetings between the project's coordinator, Joaquim Coutinho Netto from the Biochemistry and Immunology Department of FMRP, and parties interested in knowing details of the new product.
The objective of these meetings, at which investors from Germany and Italy have already participated, is to raise the capital necessary to set up the pilot plant and later on an industrial plant.
The pilot plant, scheduled to begin working this coming month of July in an old factory used for the industrialization of heart of palm, and belonging to Avamax, was projected according to the criteria demanded by the National Agency for Sanitary Vigilance (Anvisa in the Portuguese acronym).
The plant will be installed in the industrial district of Ribeir達o Preto, previously projected by the now Minister of the Treasury Department, Ant担nio Palocci, when he was the mayor of the town.
Multinational competition
The biopolymer, which will initially be launched to treat chronic ulcers of the feet and legs, is going to compete with other products from large multinational companies such as Johnson&Johnson and Novartis.
According toCoutinho, the formulae are different, but the results identical.
"This is without saying that the treatment with our product will cost, at least, ten times less", he says.
"Oneimported 15 gram tube of a healing ointment based on gel with human hormone costs US$ 350 and lasts for only a few days", Coutinho compares.
The story that led to this biomembrane had its beginning in 1994 when the at that time master's degree student in the surgery area of FMRP, F叩tima Mru辿, from the state of Goias who spent two years in Tokyo, Japan, and followed surgery patients with cancer, decided to work on her thesis with the prosthesis of Takimoto, which carried the name of the medical inventor, a compound of silicon and collagen and used to reconstruct the esophagus.
F叩tima got in touch with Coutinho in order to know how to obtain collagen from pigskin, a technique described in an article published during the decade of the 60s and which was to be used in the make up of the artificial substitute.
Today, Coutinho states that he had never imagined that that simple question concerning collagen would lead him to weekly meetings with people interested in investing in the biopolymer.
In the end, in order to get rid of the student on that occasion -- today F叩tima Mru辿 is a surgeon at the Oncology Center of the Clinical Hospital of Goi但nia --, Coutinho said to her that if she found the paper he could help her in the job of making a substitute material similar to Takimoto's.
"A very difficult and painstaking taking task for that time since there was no Internet", as she herself recalls.
Coutinho, resigned to the fact, decided to help the persistent student in the preparation of collagen from pigskin.
However, on being mixed with silicone, there was no way of making the two materials combine together.
"We couldn't reproduce the Japanese prosthesis", Coutinho recalls.
Inspiration in the past
"It was then that I had the idea of making prosthesis from the latex of the rubber tree", recalls the doctor, probably inspired in memories of the large rubber tree plantations of the small town in the interior of the state of S達o Paulo where he was born, Guapia巽u.
He thought that it would be much easier to mix the collagen in the milk from the rubber tree.
F叩tima didn't place much faith in the proposed solution, but decided to respect it.
As they were going to need someone who would make the experimental prosthesis, they found in the region of S達o Jos辿 do Rio Preto the chemist Ant担nio C辿sar Zabrowski, from the company Globbor, that sells rubber to Goodyear.
Zabrowski offered to manufacture the prosthesis and built them making use of a ribbed glass mold, composed of vegetal latex and 0.1% collagen or polylysine.
The experimental prosthesis, a tube of 8 centimeters in length by 2 centimeters in diameter was implanted in the esophagus of eight dogs.
However, an uncommon occurrence caught the attention of the researchers.
Ten days after the implant, the prostheses were expelled together with the feces of the animal.
They found this strange and decided to carry out an endoscopy in order to know what had happened, since none of the dogs appeared to be ill.
By the end of the examination both F叩tima and Coutinho were surprised with the revelation that, in such a short period of time, a new esophagus had formed in the separated fragment.
In the histological analysis (an evaluation of the tissue under the microscope), it showed itself to be practically equal to the normal esophagus, with all the layers.
"There was practically no scarring and also there was not the formation of fibrosis at the repaired location, showing a process of structural neoformation", says Coutinho."The
results were surprising and we decided to investigate the phenomenon in depth", he explains.
As the histological cut of the material showed the presence of a large quantity of blood vessels at the locality where the prosthesis had been placed, this could explain the process of the accelerated repair (healing).
However, this property of latex to stimulate angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels) was only discovered because the polymer was not obtained by the traditional method, known as vulcanization, using a temperature of between 110尊 C to 125尊 C. Zabrowski had made use of a technique of polymerization under special conditions, developed and patented by him, and later purchased by Avamax.
The proof that the method of obtaining the biopolymer was fundamental to the process of angiogenesis was done when the researchers carried ut tests using surgical gloves and contraceptives that have the same raw material, namely latex, to see how they would behave in the process of healing.
"But these materials didn't show any angiogenesis activity", Coutinho says.
Tests were even done using embryonated chickens eggs to evaluate the formation of veins, and with rabbits' ears, to verify the speed with which the process of healing occurred.
"The application of the biomaterial sped up a structural neoformation process, highly organized and without leaving a scar", the doctor concludes.
Quick healing
After completing the cycle of tests on animals, the moment arrived to begin an evaluation of the biomaterial based on vegetal latex on human patients.
In 1997, Coutinho and F叩tima submitted to the Medical Ethical Commission of the Clinical Hospital of FMRP a request to begin experiments on humans.
"This authorization was only granted one year later, allowing the student Paulo C辿sar Grisotto, who was completing his doctorate degree at that time in Ribeir達o Preto, to widen and to advance his studies, dealing with patients with chronic ulcers of difficult healing at the hospital in Itajobi (SP), a town in the region of S達o Jos辿 do Rio Preto", Coutinho says.
"On average, twelve days after starting to use dressings with the biopolymer on the patients, the chronic wounds, mainly with diabetes patients, began to show signs of evident granulation and epithelial formation, as against the six months necessary for traditional methods, that include interning in hospital", the doctor states.
According to an epidemiological survey carried out in the town of Juiz de Fora in the State of Minas Gerais, by Marco Andrey Cipriani Frade, around 2.7% of the population has chronic ulcers on their feet or legs, a percentage that reaches as high as 10% in diabetes patients.
These wounds represent the second highest reason for work absenteeism in Brazil.
Reconstructed eardrum
Six years after Dr. Grisotto had begun to carry out tests on humans, the number of patients studied in the hospitals of Ribeir達o, Itajobi, Juiz de Fora and others had reached 3,000 of whom 2,500 had ulcers and the remainder with a perforated eardrum by infection or trauma.
All of the tests were carried out after approval by the Medical Ethics Commission of the respective institutions.
The surgeries to reconstitute the eardrum using a biomembrane of latex were carried out at the Otolaryngology Sector of the Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology Department of FMRP.
This surgery, named myringoplasty, has as its objective the reconstitution of the mechanism of sound transmission.
Various materials are used for this objective, a favorite being the fascia (a layer of fibrous tissue that covers the body under the skin) of temporal muscle, cartilage, placental tissue, among others, but the results showed up to 30% of failure from the anatomic point of view and 19% of re-perforation mainly caused by the lack of blood vessels in the graft.
On the other hand, the use of a biomembrane from latex showed intense vascularization, as indicated in the work of the otolaryngologists Jos辿 Antonio Apparecido de Oliveira and Miguel Angelo Hyppolito from USP at Ribeir達o Preto named "Myringoplasty Making Use of a New Biosynthetic Material", presented in 1998 during the 34th Brazilian Congress of Otolaryngology in Porto Alegre.
The team won first place by describing the success of the grafts using the biopolymer.
"We verified intense vascularization in 100% of the grafts, which is not usual when not using a membrane made from natural latex", states one of the parts of the prize-winning paper.
The report refers to only nineteen perforated eardrums that received the biomaterial as a transitory implant during myringoplasty.
Today the number of successes has reached five hundred.
Two doctorate theses, developed at the Surgery and Anatomy Department of FMRP, under the guidance of Professors Jesualdo Cherri and Carlos Eli Piccinato, and defended by the vascular surgeons M叩rio Augusto da Silva Freitas and Paulo Cesar Grisotto, respectively in August of 2001 and February of 2003, have pointed out, after tests done with animals, that it is possible to recover cardiovascular arteries by way of the use of latex prostheses.
But as yet more experimental work is necessary before making tests on human patients, in order to evaluate the efficiency of this material that could substitute the current synthetic prosthesis or biological material of animal origin, such as the pericardium of the cow or pig.
These pieces of research show that the biopolymer based on vegetal latex could still give origin to many other products, with diverse applications.
The dressings are only the first step for the company Pele Nova Biotecnologia to enter into dispute for a national market estimated at around 4.5 million people, who, most probably, could not pay the very high cost for the imported medicine.

Expanded image
National technology lowers production costs of special lenses made with injectable plastics
Samuel Antenor
Special lenses that make for a better quality of the images in medical magnifying glasses, microscopes, night vision glasses, and even cameras have begun to be produced by Optovac, a small company from Osasco, in Greater S達o Paulo.
These lenses guarantee high quality images, without the small distortions of conventional lenses.
They are called non-spheric or aspheric, and they can successfully remain in focus in a more efficient way, bringing down to acceptable levels the so-called spherical aberration, the failure in the formation of the image caused by the refraction of the light on spherical surfaces, a physical phenomenon that manifests itself in conventional lenses.
The aspheric ones have a kind of curvature that makes it possible to get sharper images.
They can be made with specific curvatures, avoiding focal problems that jeopardize the visual quality of the image observed.
Started two years ago, the project has resulted in molds for the production of the plastic lenses, a process that should begin in October this year.
From the economic point of view, the mastery of this technology takes on greater importance, to the extent that high quality aspheric lenses in transparent and moldable plastics are of interest to a wide range of industrial uses.
In the medical area, in the magnifying glasses used in various operations; in the military area, in lenses for night vision; and in laboratories, in optic microscopes.
But the ordinary consumer may also benefit from the same optic quality of the aspheric lenses put into glasses, leaving them lighter and with the lenses not as thick.
Another use that is already common is in cameras.
The countries that produce this equipment, like Japan and Germany for example, use plastic aspheric lenses in the object glasses in conjunction with lenses of common glass, because they ally focal quality with the material durability.
The problem is that, for cameras, aspheric lenses only acquire competitiveness if they are manufactured on a large scale.
Other areas where these lenses are increasingly sought after and highly competitive are electronics and telecommunications.
They are products that have had their demand increased with the application of optic components in plastic, sophisticated and of a low cost, such as video cameras, light sensors and optical couplings (connections that join optical fibers together).
Another use that is ever more common is in compact disc readers, when the laser beam crosses through the aspheric lens before touching the surface of the CD.
"These are very competitive areas.
I can only see possibilities for us to work in these areas in the medium term", Nobre reckons.
"Our goal is to work in smaller and more limited niches, which the major manufacturers have no interest in."
Astronomy and medicine
For S辿rgio Nobre, the challenge is to have prices that are compatible with the products from Asia and a better quality.
"Our labor costs and production expenses are higher than those of the Chinese, for example, but we are going to face up to them with technology", explains the director, who intends to qualify the company for exporting, in particular with products intended for the educational area.
Optovac's forecast sales for this are between R$ 1 million and R$ 1.5 million, in which the aspheric lenses should have a share of around R$ 100,000 a month, from October onwards.
The secret, in which time and money has to be invested, lies in the mold for the lens that Optovac is developing.
With efficient molding, it is possible to marry the advantages of these lenses with the low cost of injectable plastic.
The data for the manufacture of the molds for aspheric lenses are created and organized on a computer and inserted into an Computerized Numerical Control (CNC) Aspheric Generator, equipment used to repeat the manufacture of a product.
It carries out a reading of the information programmed by the software and makes a mold for the lenses, on the basis of a pre-machined piece of glass or ceramic.
To forge the mold, a grindstone goes round the piece, touching its side, which is refrigerated by water and a soluble oil that, besides maintaining its temperature, avoids undue abrasion of the pieces.
After this stage, another apparatus, a profilometer, measures the profile of the semi-finished mold.
If there are differences between the data originally programmed by the computer and the end result, the software generates a correction file and the Aspheric Generator carries out the finishing touch on the mold.
Developing from scratch
Created in 1986, with the goal of making equipment with technologies involving fine mechanics, Optovac went on to work in the optic segment, with research products for the educational area and for general consumption, such as kits for teaching science, telescopes and microscopes, and they even developed this kind of equipment for research institutes connected with the University of S達o Paulo (USP) and the State University of Campinas (Unicamp).
However, with a limited commercial field and the opening up of the market over the last decade -- which brought products with more competitive prices to Brazil --, the company found itself obliged to invest in research and to develop from scratch a technology that already existed abroad.
And why not simply import the technology?
According to S辿rgio Nobre, the reason is simple: the costs of importing come to US$ 2 million -- for a production that caters to the small niches that there are in Brazil -- are far higher than the cost of developing it locally, and are unjustifiable in the light of the small demand in the domestic market.
With the aim of raising the quality of the products at a lower cost, the PIPE project made the company's technological triumph possible, developing the first prototypes in two years.
Work went on simultaneously on technological development and on possible applications in products.
Optovac nowadays has the capacity to supply the domestic market in a customized fashion, as the consumption of these items is small in Brazil.
"We are producing 20,000 spherical lenses for one customer (he cannot mention the name of the company, nor the application for this product); and for the Nuclear and Energy Research Institute (Ipen), we have just produced a single lens (aspheric), specially developed for use in this institute's research, that is to say, we have a differentiated structure that allows us flexibility in production", says the company's director.
Optovac is even accredited by the Brazilian Army's aviation unit for the development (of aspheric lenses) and maintenance of optical equipment, such as the night vision glasses, which are currently imported and depend on maintenance outside the country.

Digital scissors
Software generated at UFPE wins market and prevents losses in the paper industry
Ver担nica Falc達o, from Recife
Nothing better and cheaper has yet been found than industrial cardboard packaging, whether it is for packing TV sets, fridges, cans of tomato paste or bottles of detergent.
Although it has been present for many years at the final point of the industrial process, these boxes need constant improvements in their manufacturing particularly to reduce the quantity of leftovers without any loss of quality.
It was thinking of solving this problem in relation to cutting sheets of cardboard that mathematician S坦stenes Lins, a professor at the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), created the Conjug software, already in use in industries from all over Brazil.
The success of this product is one of the most emblematic examples of a study generated in an academic environment that wins market and brings important contributions for the productive system.
The calculations for cutting the cardboard previously used to be done manually.
"All that was used was a calculator and common sense", Lins reveals.
The difficulty is that there are, literally, billions of possibilities for cutting the large rectangle to which the roll of cardboard is reduced, when used to make boxes.
"And human beings can only arrive at two, three, or ten at the most.
"Conjug is based on an algorithm -- a process for calculating -- conceived in 1986, in partnership with students for a master's degree.
A member of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences (ABC), he tells how he created the algorithm thinking of reducing the losses of paper.
"I just did not imagine that it was something that was innovating.
In December of the next year, he sold the first version of the software to Klabin's factory in Pernambuco.
Today, Conjug is used in ten of the company's units, where they produce pulp, paper and boxes of corrugated cardboard.
Family company
Lins estimates that Conjug is employed in over 10% of the corrugators in Brazil, a kind of machine that makes corrugated cardboard.
To market the software, the professor set up the LinSoft company, managed by his wife.
His son Lauro Didier Lins, who is studying for a doctorate in Computational Mathematics at UFPE, is responsible for the technical part, along with a sister of the professor, Nadja Lins, an electrical engineer and network administrator at UFPE'S Information Technology Center.
Besides Klabin's factories, the software is used in paper industries in the states of Amazonas, S達o Paulo and Cear叩.
Another system created by the mathematician's team, and one that transcended the limits of the university, is S-Plex, used in cutting coils of steel.
Unlike the cutting of cardboard, in which the sheets are separated for making the boxes, the coil of steel is sliced into strips.
The process is like cutting a Swiss roll.
The software has been in use since November 2002 at Armco, an industrial concern that produces sheets of steel in S達o Paulo and Manaus.
The man responsible for the company's Integrated Planning sector, Edson Jos辿 Lopes, estimates that the use of the system has brought about a 20% reduction in scrap.
"I am eliminating a critical point by adopting S-Plex", he sums up.
LinSoft was created in 1992.
Without any competition, the software went so far as to plan the cutting of cardboard boxes in 20% of the factories in the country.
"We had no competitors at the beginning, but today they exist", Lins has found out.
This calls for a constant evolution of Conjug.
Today, it covers work in a network and is not just focused on reducing losses with paper.
It also takes profit into account, since it is capable of planning all the production.
"It is possible to arrange the cutting according to the orders and to their urgency", Lins explains.
Another variable included in Conjug is the paper inventory.
"Proper planning of production avoids losses and improves productivity", he adds.
The Lins family company is also developing software aimed at packing boxes.
It is called ExpedPlex, and it plans the way boxes are arranged on pallets, in containers, and on trucks.
Pallets are the wooden platforms on which the cargo is piled up for transport and storage.
The system is based on four algorithms.
One of them generated a publication in the European Journal of Operations Research.
In this case, the objective is to save space.
S坦stenes calculates that the addition of from 5% to 8% in the volume stowed trucks generates a saving of one less truck for each 15 to 20 trips.
Another software related to the organization of boxes is PalletZoom, copies of which were acquired by the Bompre巽o supermarket chain.
The system is capable of defining how best to arrange the packaged products on the pallets.
To do so, the user just has to supply details of the dimensions of the boxes and of the pallets.
The machine calculates how the cargo is to be stowed and provides an illustration of how the boxes should be piled up.
Lins explains that he created PalletZoom not only to make for better storage, but also greater speed in transporting the products, because the arrangement allows for a larger number of boxes on the pallet.
If today LinSoft's products are in use all over the country, at the beginning Professor Lins had great difficulties, in particular to convince the people from industry to accept the product.
The first company that he tried was Ponsa, of the Klabin group, in Pernambuco, back in 1986.
"They put me in contact with their branch in Rio de Janeiro.
Afterwards, in December 1987, we agreed that I would perfect the software and that they would buy a version.
There were more or less six or seven months of development.
Klabin bought the first version of Conjug, but only used the software for two months.
At the time, Lins was not contacted by the company and only found out later that they had desisted.
"Computer were very bad, they had little memory and were slow.
The technology for developing software also left a lot to be desired.
The interfaces were no good", he remembers.
Even so, the program worked.
"It optimized, it cut down the leftovers", he guarantees.
After the attempt with Klabin, Lins "forgot" Conjug for three years.
"I took care of my own life, doing theoretical mathematics and publishing my papers", says he, the author of 30 articles published in scientific magazines with an international circulation.
In July 1991, technicians from Ponsa once again approached him.
"There was a firm intention of really using the program, and this time it worked out."
In 1993, Klabin decided to adopt the software at their factories in Piracicaba and Jundia鱈.
"Afterwards, it was the turn of the factory in the city of Rio de Janeiro, in February 1994.
Then all the branches of the company came", he tells.
With the success at Klabin, several other companies became interested.
In 2001, LinSoft was present in over 20% of the companies in the corrugated cardboard market.
Mathematician Paulo Seixas Avino, a business analysts with Klabin, says that Conjug guarantees agility in the process, reliability in the results, and, above all, a reduction in the losses of raw material, which can reach 2% of the production.
For Lins, the software's success is not just related to the theoretical aspect of the product, but also to an interface that is pleasing to use and gives the users confidence.

Lucrative Marriage
A fourteen-year partnership between the university and the company CSN has brought in some US$ 85 million for the company
Marili Ribeiro
The greatest difficulty in very successful partnerships between a university and business, when working together in search of technological innovation, is to quantify the gains.
By the calculations of the gigantic company Companhia Sider炭rgica Nacional (CSN), the improvement in the productivity of their steel mill at Volta Redonda, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, added to the increase in the quality of the steels obtained there, has resulted in gains in the order of US$ 85 million during the fourteen year period of marriage with the Federal University of S達o Carlos (UFScar) and the S達o Paulo State University (Unesp) of Araraquara.
Profits coming from the application of forty one projects for the implementation of new methodologies and processes after research carried out by the Interdisciplinary Electrochemical and Ceramic Laboratory (Liec), which exists in the two universities, along with CSN's own Research Center.
For the past three years, this laboratory has made up part of the Multidisciplinary Center for the Development of Ceramic Materials (CMDMC), one of the ten Research, Innovation and Diffusion Centers (Cepids) that make up part of a special program established by FAPESP.
The gains by the CSN through the innovations represent a considerable volume of money for a country with little tradition in giving incentive towards research development.
This value is even greater if we consider that a good part of this resulted from evolution in refractory ceramics, an input which less than ten years ago weighed heavily on Brazilian imports.
The gains and the reversal of this point in the trade balance were attained thanks to the standards conquered by the Liec and CSN's researchers, who spread their knowledge all the way through the productivity chain, which stretches from the raw material producers for refractory material manufacture to the steel companies.
Currently, many national companies, as is the case with the company Magnesita from the state of Minas Gerais, have turned into exporters of technology on refractory ceramics using magnesium-carbon and magnesium-carbon-aluminum mixtures.
Everything started with operational difficulties at the blast furnaces, the heart of the business of a steel mill, where pig iron, the stage before steel, is produced.
CSN hired a team of consultants from a Japanese company, who diagnosed a problem of thermal shock in the ceramic burner of the regenerators.
Responsible for the supply of hot air for the blast furnace, the paralysis of the operating of this equipment for repairs, scheduled to last for a minimum of six months according to the Japanese technical team, would have created a drama in the production of the mill.
Frightened when faced by such a prognosis and probable losses -- in the end, the estimation for the repair of the burner was around US$ 15 million --, the managers at CSN decided to turn to Liec before making a final decision.
Two days of incessant discussions sealed the year 1989 as one of the start of a marriage capable of producing fine fruit.
At that time, after the evaluation of the UFSCar researchers, it was seen that the Japanese consultants had precipitated their analysis.
There was no problem of thermal shock in the refractory material of the ceramic burner, but there was strong corrosion, which could be counteracted by the installation of filters to remove particles of iron oxide coming from the gas of the blast furnace.
Everything was done without ever stopping work.
As he likes to remember, while emphasizing each word with the diction typical of a school teacher, Professor Elson Longo, the director of the CMDMC in S達o Carlos, underlines: "When we arrived at CSN, they were producing 4 million tons of steel per year.
Today they are producing 5.5 million tons practically with the same equipment.
And this is taking into account that the nominal capacity of the steel mill was only 4.6 million".
The gain of 1.5 million tons is due to a complete change in the concept of the refractory material during the fourteen years of mutually living together.
The excellence in the mastery of these ceramic materials was made possible by a combination of investments at the Liec in S達o Carlos.
It was established with resources to the tune of US$ 400,000, sponsored by FAPESP, the Financier of Studies and Projects (Finep), the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), the Bank of Brazil, and the Companhia Brasileira de Metalurgia e Metais (CBMM).
And, even attending to the demands of various large industrial groups present in their portfolio of clients, it annually receives only R$ 180,000 of private incentive for its maintenance, which costs around R$ 1.3 million per year.
The bulk of the necessary resources comes from financing agencies.
As well as FAPESP and the CNPq, there is collaboration from the Coordination for the Training of Personnel at Tertiary Level (Capes).
Accumulation of knowledge
In the specific case of the steel mill, the steels gained enormous competitiveness abroad after the incorporation of the technological conquests.
"National steel reaches the United States cheaper that the one produced by them", informs Longo.
The gains calculated by CSN of US$ 85 million through the partnership are considered to be a conservative estimate.
"This is a number a long way away from reality because only the result obtained during the first year in which the innovation is implemented is considered, without taking into consideration later gains", the Professor explains.
Today, in a clear sign of the importance of the partnership, CSN keeps an apartment to house the university researchers who spend periods working at the Volta Redonda mill.
They rotate doing research within the mill itself.
Currently there are six doctorate professors, three students researching their doctorate degrees, two on their master's degree and a further three undergraduates, all involved with projects concerning the mill."The
contribution in knowledge and ideas by the university is a notable point in our area of research and development", explains Sidiney Silva from CSN.
"For example, in the steel mill the researchers find instruments and conditions to carry out experiments with pig iron and liquid steel.
We now have a series of simulation plants where they can finalize their studies initiated within the laboratory."
After starting off by saving the ceramic burner, the Liec researchers, together with those at CSN, introduced various alterations that have guaranteed the performance and the useful life of these blast furnaces, from the change in the refractory material to the manner of manufacturing them.
"Only in the improvement of the conditions of the blast furnaces there were twelve projects linked to operational questions, being that, with just the techniques of the addition of titanium into the melting pot or crucible, the lower region of the furnace where continuously the liquid pig iron that is produced accumulates, they have managed an economy valued around US$ 13 million for the company", Longo explains.
"The crucible is the heart of the blast furnace.
It is surrounded with refractory blocks made of carbon and its performance is vital for the production of the mill", says Silva from CSN.
The innovations applied to the crucible after laboratory research resulted, among other advantages, in a reduction of thermal loses during the process, with a consequent saving economy in the reducing agent (coal that will be turned into coke), imported raw materials, used in prolonging the useful life of the equipment.
"The life of a blast furnace, which was on average ten years, is now programmed for twenty", highlights Longo.
One of the aspects studied in depth was the corrosion present in the coating surrounding the crucible.
"We sought to evaluate the effects of titanium, which, in contact with the carbon and nitrogen of the pig iron and with the calcium oxide of the slag of the blast furnace, brings about the formation of a protective layer on the refractory coating," Silva explains.
Torpedo carriage
The next material step of introducing technological innovations into the routine of CSN involved the torpedo carriage, given the job of transporting the liquid pig iron of the blast furnaces to the converters where it will be transformed into steel.
One of the problems in the management of this equipment resides in a loss of energy during the filling of the carriage in the blast furnaces and afterwards transporting to the steel plant.
The suggestion by the researchers was the installation of a layer of micro porous silica on the refractory cover of the torpedo carriage.
Immediately there was a decrease of on average 25属 C in the temperature during the transportation of the liquid pig iron to the steel plant.
The infinity of details of this type of technological marathon by obtaining improved steels has prospered more than just CSN.
Professor Jos辿 Arana Varela from Unesp, the innovation coordinator at the Ceramic-Cepid informed that the Liec now maintains conventions just as old as that with CSN an example being with the CBMM.
There are other partnerships of long standing, with White Martins for some eight years, and with the Brazilian Industry of Refractory Articles (Ibar), for almost ten years.

Change in production
Some fifty years ago Johanna D旦bereiner Began her biology search into nitrogen fixation
Neldson Marcolin
A young Czech researcher, twenty-seven years of age, landed in Rio de Janeiro in 1951 and a little more than ten years later was already one of the main people responsible for an appreciable change in the manner of production of some Brazilian agricultural crops.
A recent graduate in agronomy from the University of Munich, Germany, Johanna D旦bereiner (1924-2000) was hired by the National Service for Agronomy Research, of the Ministry of Agriculture in the town of Serop辿dica (RJ), and began work on microbiology of the soil supervised by Alvaro Barcelos Fagundes, at that time the director of the unit.
Starting in 1953, the researcher turned her attention to the area of biology known as nitrogen fixation (BNF).
Johanna's starting point was her observations concerning bahia grass, which grows everywhere and remains green and flourishing without nitrogenous fertilizer.
During 1958 to 1959, she published, along with some colleagues a survey on nitrogen fixation in sugarcane in theBrazilian Biology Magazine .
When she exposed her data on the occurrence of these microorganisms in sugarcane, there was some suspicion from the majority of fellow researchers.
"Nobody took me seriously because there was nothing existed on the literature on the description of the association of these bacteria with higher plants", Johanna said during an interview with the researcher Carlos Chagas Filho (1910-2000), published in the bookCientistas do Brasil -- Depoimentos [Scientists of Brazil -- Statements] (Commemorative Edition of the Fifty Years of the SBPC).
In 1963 she was asked to participate in the recently founded National Soya Bean Commission.
Right away, she got herself involved in a row: the tendency was to use nitrogenous fertilizers of very high cost.
Johanna insisted that Brazil must wager on the use of bacteria nitrogen fixers and won the discussion.
The result is known: from 1964, the Brazilian program for soya improvement was completely based on the process of BNF and the country turned itself into the second largest world producer of this grain -- the annual economy using nitrogen fixing fertilizers reaches more than US$ 1.5 billion.
Johanna always worked with The Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa Agrobiology with its headquarters in the town of Serop辿dica) and afterwards with the Rural Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.
Her studies gained her international recognition -- she was nominated for the Nobel Prize in 1997 -- and even influenced the main lines of research about this theme in Brazil and abroad.
For example, in May specialists from seven institutions in Rio announced the conclusion of the sequencing ofGluconacetobacter diazotrophicus , one of the bacterium responsible for nitrogen fixing in the sugarcane.
With the information obtained, the researchers will attempt to improve the metabolic performance of the bacterium in order to widen its capability in nitrogen fixation.
