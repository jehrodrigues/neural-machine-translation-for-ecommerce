Laboratory completes project for new synchrotron light production ring
Marcos de Oliveira
Brazil's largest scientific and technological research instrument is to get an even greater and more powerful version by 2015.
This radiation is generated by electrons produced within an accelerator and then inserted into a metal ring with a 93-meter circumference (the new ring is to have a 460-meter circumference), in an ultra-high vacuum environment.
The new source has already been named Sirius -- a name chosen from the staff's suggestions -- in reference to the most brilliant night sky star.
It is important to build this because the current instrument is becoming obsolete.
The Brazilian synchrotron is about to complete 13 years of service and technological and scientific needs demand more up-to-date equipment.
``The evolution is necessary because, at the end of the day, science is competition.
The important, relevant questions in the areas served by the Synchrotron are always new, as several of the old ones have been answered already.
The new ones, however, require more sophisticated equipment,'' says the physicist Antônio José Roque da Silva, LNLS director since July 2009 and a professor at the Physics Institute of the University of São Paulo (USP).
One of the advantages of a laboratory such as the Synchrotron is its cross-disciplinary nature, involving people who do research into biology, materials science, technology, energy and paleontology.
``With the LNLS, the country can compete in several areas and use the same laboratory simultaneously, the year round, to carry out its experiments.''
There are currently some 50 sources of synchrotron light in the world, of which 16 are third generation that went on-stream as from 1994.
They are characterized by their more brilliant radiation, with more light being generated and with low emittance, this being a unit of measurement that determines the size and the divergence (spreading) of the focus of the light source.
Sirius is being designed to have a 1.7 nanometer-radian (nm.rad), whereas the current synchrotron source has 100 nm.rad.
This means greater brilliance on a smaller radiation beam and also with a smaller angle of opening.
It should be one of the brightest sources in the world.
For example, the Soleil Synchrotron in the town of Saint-Aubain, France, which was inaugurated in 2006, has emittance of 3.7 nm.rad, while the Diamond Synchrotron, in Oxfordshire, England, which went on-stream in 2007, has 2.7 nm.rad.
``Of the 50 sources of synchrotron radiation in the world, only 30 are open to researchers from outside the institution to which the laboratory belongs.
There are 11 in Europe, 7 in the United States, 10 in Asia, 1 in Australia and 1 in South America, which is the LNLS.
If the second source is not built, Brazil and South America will disappear from the world's synchrotron radiation map,'' says the French physicist Yves Petroff, LNLS's scientific director since December 2009 and the person responsible for the scientific objectives of the new light source project.
These studies led to approximately 250 articles in scientific journals.
``Smaller countries, such as Spain, South Korea and Taiwan are building third-generation sources,'' says Petroff.
At the age of 73, he has had a long career in synchrotron laboratories around the world.
From 1993 to 2001 he was the director-general of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France, and has also worked in similar laboratories in the United States.
Additionally, he has held the position of scientific director of LURE (the acronym in French for the Laboratory for the Use of Electromagnetic Radiation) and of CNRS (the acronym in French for the National Center for Scientific Research).
He sits on several synchrotron scientific committees, including that of LNLS, since its implantation stage back in 1988.
An interesting point is that the number of users from the Energy Department in four American synchrotrons grew by 40% (from 6,000 to 8,400) between 2000 and 2008, while the users of the French ESRF grew by 36% between 2003 and 2009,'' he says.
``A substantial part of this growth is due to using this radiation to study biological structures.
All pharmaceutical companies, for instance, use the lines of light for this purpose.''
He also reminds us that recently the exploration of specific properties of the X-rays produced by synchrotron machines have enabled the obtainment of three-dimensional images of any object, with resolutions smaller than a micrometer (one thousandth of a millimeter), in paleontology, archeology and environmental studies.
``I invited Yves Petroff to help restructure the LNLS scientific division and to help with the scientific objectives to use the new source and the new lines of light, as they are becoming increasingly sophisticated,'' says Roque.
Permanent magnets -- Besides meeting the required specifications of a third generation synchrotron light source, the project also plans to achieve a much bigger reduction in power consumption.
To this end, new solutions are being tested in the LNLS, based on innovative technologies.
The first is to adopt permanent magnets, a global novelty for this type of laboratory.
These dipoles currently function with electromagnets, consisting of metals wrapped in wires that turn into magnets once they are electrified.
This system dictates that a number of other instruments be attached , such as a refrigeration system and coils, which consume a lot of power.
``The permanent magnets are similar to refrigerator magnets,'' compares Rodrigues.
They don't need electric energy to work and are sold commercially worldwide.
They are made out of ferrite, which is cheap, and alloys that include neodymium, iron and boron.
To date, only one machine in the word, an antiprotons accumulator at Fermilab, in the United States, runs with permanent magnets.
``Nobody has yet had the courage to do this in synchrotrons, although the understanding of these materials has progressed quite a lot,'' says Rodrigues.
Cutting power consumption carries a lot of weight in this decision.
With the permanent magnets, savings of 6.5 gigawatts-hour (GWh) are expected, or R$4.5 million a year.
Another innovation developed at the Synchrotron, in collaboration with Soleil, the French laboratory, is to be used both for the new source and the old one.
It is a radically different radiofrequency (RF) system that will save more than R$1 million in power a year.
The laboratory's current power bill is some R$3.5 million a year.
The RF system replenishes the energy that the electrons lose in the form of synchrotron light.
Though resorting to the most advanced technologies, almost all such laboratories around the world operate using electronic valves almost one meter long, each of which costs US$150 thousand.
Such valves were heavily used in electronic devices before the commercial advent of power transistors.
In the synchrotron case, they are especially made in England to supply the high energy needed to amplify the 476 mega-hertz (MHz) frequency.
This electromagnetic wave, rather than expanding in space, as in a radio station, for instance, is imprisoned within chambers called resonating cavities along the ring.
The current source uses two such RF generators of 30 kilowatts (kW) each.
``To date, the only way of joining high power and high frequencies was this valve,'' says the electronic technician Claudio Pardine, coordinator of the LNLS radiofrequency laboratory.
Pardine, in collaboration with the French researchers from Soleil, developed a new system called solid state amplifier, comprised of hundreds of small electronic boxes with 250 watts of power.
``As early as 2001, LNLS was the world's first laboratory to replace the valve by the solid state amplifier in a system of one kW for a synchrotron light injector,'' says Pardine.
There are countless advantages to this, but the main one is really to save power.
``To supply 30 kW, the traditional valve system requires power of 170 kW; the new solid state one needs 60 kW.''
At present, the RF system consumes almost 1.8 gigawatts-hour (GWh) a year, meaning that the cost of power for the RF equipment amounts to R$1.3 million a year.
With the implementation of the new system, there will be savings of about 50%, not to speak of eliminating the need to replace the valve every five years.
``We stop being hostage to the manufacturer.
Maintenance becomes easier and cheaper.''
Soleil, the French laboratory, was the first to install a solid state amplifier with tens of kilowatts.
``We built some of the components of these amplifiers at LNLS in 2005,'' recalls Pardine.
``We sold the parts at cost to make these prototypes that we then developed jointly.''
Pardine follows the guidance of the Chinese researcher Ti Ruan, who currently works at Soleil and who previously taught at the University of Paris.
Ruan persuaded the French laboratory directors, during construction, to use the solid state amplifier.
However, another major laboratory, Diamond, in England, inaugurated in 2007, preferred the valve.
Pardine highlights that the idea of using solid state amplifiers is an old one, but this only became feasible now, thanks to the evolution of materials and electronic equipment.
To develop and build the new RF towers, he got financing from Finep, the Studies and Projects Finance Agency, under a program for electric energy equipment, in the amount of R$1 million.
Solid ground -- To run exemplarily, Sirius will require super-stability in the large storage ring, to ensure that the electrons are not deflected by more than one thousandth of a millimeter (micrometer) from their projected orbit.
The same super-stability also applies to the light lines.
``There are small soil variations that are imperceptible under normal circumstances, but when one works on a micrometric scale, they become very important,'' says Ricardo Rodrigues.
The project therefore includes a hardened super-floor, 200 meters in diameter and 1 meter thick, with no joins.
``Nobody has yet made this type of flooring in Brazil.
It's 20 thousand cubic meters of concrete to be produced in one week, 24 hours a day.
The layers are poured one over another and the curing (drying) of the material can't be fast.''
Special logistics will be set up, including a concrete plant and an ice plant next to the building site of the new source.
The initial budget estimate for Sirius is approximately R$400 million, spread over six years.
The money should come independently from the Ministry of Science and Technology or in partnership with other federal institutions.
All three are coordinated by CNPEM (the National Center of Research into Energy and Materials), whose head, as from June, will be professor Walter Colli, formerly a professor at the Chemistry Institute of the University of São Paulo (USP).
LNLS has an experienced team heading the project that already knows how a synchrotron is built.
Ricardo Rodrigues was one of the first three researchers hired in August 1986 by CNPq (the National Scientific and Technological Development Center), which managed LNLS at the time, to build the laboratory.
``We had Cylon Gonçalves da Silva as director, Aldo Craievich to look after the researchers' use of the lab, and me to look after the project and the construction, which took 10 years,'' Rodrigues recalls.
Acquiring the experience and the know-how took a long time.
I think we used the best method for learning something.
The hired staff, an engineer or physicist fresh out of university, was given the following message: `You have to do this.
We'll help as much as possible, we'll work together.'
Nobody went to do a doctorate or take special course.
We had them take trips to visit other labs and they'd ask: `How do you do it?','' says Rodrigues.
Physicist Liu Lin was one such professional on the initial team.
``In 1985, when I was doing my master's degree at USP's Physics Institute, in São Carlos, I worked on the project of the ring's magnetic network and I did dynamic simulations of the electron beam.
Afterwards, I was on the team that spent three months at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) at Stanford University, in California, in the United States,'' Liu says.
``We learnt a lot because there they make instruments and we had the opportunity of designing a fictitious machine that enabled us to get acquainted with the physics of accelerators,'' says Rodrigues.
This same ideal of building instruments and systems used in the construction of the first ring will be employed in the upcoming one.
``We have designed and purchased a number of things, but in financial terms only 16% of the first machine was imported.''
As the current leader of the LNLS Accelerator Physics Group, Liu studies the dynamics of electrons under the effect of the electromagnetic field.
``We designed these fields so as to ensure that a strong electron beam with high energy can be stored in a stable manner, producing synchrotron light for several hours.
To achieve this, we must specify among other things a magnetic network, which will determine all the properties of the synchrotron light beam produced,'' says Liu.
For Rodrigues, the project is almost complete and the outlook is for construction to take half the time the first machine took.
``Now it's no longer urgent to train personnel; the group of people coordinating the project is still young.''

Tridimensional image
3D TV prototype does away with special glasses
Yuri Vasconcelos
Tridimensional (3D) television technology is one of the major attractions of the World Cup in South Africa for those who were unable to travel and watch the matches in the South African stadiums.
Twenty-five of the Cup's matches -- including the three in which Brazil played in the first stage of the competition -- were transmitted in 3D, the same technology that won over millions of spectators around the world with the movie Avatar in the cinemas.
As in this superproduction directed by James Cameron, the spectator must use special glasses to see the matches with tridimensional images, which create the feeling of depth and relief.
However, experts believe that in the future 3D technology will no longer be hostage to this bothersome device that generates discomfort, visual tiredness and headaches for some people -- not to speak of the hygiene issue involved in sharing glasses with other people in the cinema.
In many countries, there is research under way to create tridimensional TV without special glasses.
In Brazil, this technology is gaining shape in the studies of researchers from the State University of Campinas (Unicamp).
Led by professor Jose Joaquin Lunazzi, they have developed several prototypes of a 3D TV set that produces holographic images.
``Our technology, which we have called Holo TV, plans to get rid of the glasses and offer full visual comfort.
It bears no resemblance to any system in the world, even in terms of prototypes,'' explains Lunazzi.
``It consists of images that are projected onto almost transparent screens, in which the absence of the vision of the support generates a ghost-like figure that is similar to a holographic image.
The filmed scene can be seen without glasses with the same smoothness and naturalness of a hologram,'' he says.
One of Brazil's pioneers in the study of holography, Lunazzi began his research into the creation of a 3D TV set back in 1984.
Ten years later he obtained FAPESP support and acquired a movie camera, a projector, holographic film, a laser device and photographic lenses.
With these tools, he set up a system for generating and reproducing holographic images.
In 1988, he presented the first prototype of his holographic 3D TV set.
Off the screen -- Just like the devices that offer traditional 3D technology and that require special glasses, holographic 3D TVs also project images beyond the screen, but they still need adjustments before they can be launched.
Research centers such the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), high technology enterprises such as Holografika (a Hungarian company) and the large manufacturers of electronic devices are all working on the construction of commercial models.
Last year, Philips, the Dutch firm, carried out trials with a 3D TV set that did away with the glasses, but that required viewer to sit in a fixed position in front of the set to avoid seeing jumbled images.
Because of this limitation, development was suspended.
The device used a technology known as autostereoscopy in which the lenses of the set's screen create multiple regions in alternation in front of the screen itself.
This very same technology was used by Samsung, the Korean manufacturer, in a prototype shown to the public in January of this year at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2010, the world's largest electronic fair, held in Las Vegas, United States.
More recently (last April), a Japanese firm, VMJ, presented at a Tokyo technology fair a 65-inch TV that showed 3D productions without requiring glasses.
The technology was successful, but it must still overcome obstacles in order to become commercial, including lowering production costs and eliminating the need for the viewer to sit in certain positions relative to the screen in order to see the image properly -- the same barrier that the Philips models encountered.
The technology created at Unicamp, according to Lunazzi, does not present such difficulty.
``The person can change positions as much as he or she wants without losing the 3D illusion,'' he guarantees.
This is due to the discovery of an optical principle called codification-decodification of depth by light diffraction.
I developed this principle when I returned from a holography exhibition in Germany in 1984 and it was divulged in an article in the journal Optical Engineering in 1990.
Ever since, nobody has applied it.
Our research is advancing, but to date we have only managed to create monochromatic 3D images, with no color or brightness.''
Early last year, along with three colleagues in his group, Lunazzi wrote a new article in the journal Optics Letters, describing the system that they have created, which has a 30 cm by 60 cm screen.
One important detail of the technology is that the screen, which is transparent and made out of photographic film with high-resolution silver salts, is lit obliquely, sideways -- unlike the conventional screens, which are lit from behind or in front.
This is a fundamental aspect, according to the researcher, for the process to occur and the viewer to enjoy freedom of movement without losing the images 3D illusion.
Lunazzi has already presented his technology in congresses in Japan, China, the United States, South Korea and European countries.
``Holo TV has an experimental, prototypical character.
It is useful to encourage research around the world and to show that we can engage in cutting-edge research in Brazil.''
In its current stage, it could be used in the large promotional stands of companies at fairs.
In 2008, Samsung researchers visited Lunazzi's laboratory at Unicamp's Physics Institute, to become acquainted with the new holographic technique by double diffraction of white light without the intermediation of the lens, used in Holo TV.
However, no agreement was signed.
The researcher believes that the commercial viability of his tridimensional TV will require partnership with a major global producer of electrical and electronic goods interested in investing in this research.

Microsoft Research uses anti-spam screening logic to find vulnerable points in HIV virus
Dinorah Ereno
The same strategy used to create the filters that screen out spam, the unsolicited electronic messages that invade our e-mail in-boxes, is being used by the team of researcher David Heckerman, senior director of the Research Group on e-Science at Microsoft Research, to develop a vaccine against HIV, the Aids virus.
``We realized that to be successful, a vaccine would have to attack specific points of the virus, just like anti-spam screens do to select e-mails,'' says Heckerman, during a conference at the Latin American Faculty Summit 2010.
The event, held jointly by Microsoft Research and FAPESP from May 12 to 14 in the sea-side town of Guarujá in São Paulo state, centered on the theme ``Computer Science : making a difference.''
More than 200 Computer Science experts from 13 countries met at this sixth Faculty Summit, to hear presentations of innovative projects in several fields of knowledge.
A physician by training who did his doctorate in computer science, Heckerman was one of the people responsible for creating the first program for identifying and screening spam in 1997.
``Just like the spammers change their e-mails to get through our screening, HIV also undergoes mutations to deceive the immune system and so manage to reproduce freely,'' he compared.
The chief difficulty in developing an anti-Aids vaccine is that the virus changes constantly.
``However, we believe that there are some regions in the HIV genome that are presumably vulnerable to the mutation,'' stated the researcher.
Finding these areas is quite a complex task, because one must map all the possible mutations of the virus and the configurations of the protein HLA (human leukocyte antigens), which is the immune system's tool for hindering HIV reproduction.
HLA invades the virus and removes the epitope, a protein fragment responsible for the HIV virus' genetic information.
``We're looking for these regions called vulnerable epitopes,'' said Heckerman.
``Our objective is to develop a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize only the vulnerable points along the sequence of the HIV genetic material.''
To do this, more than one hundred researchers around the world are using a tool called PhyloD, developed by Heckerman's group, to evaluate how HIV behaves as from the moment it infects a person.
Computers cross the data of people's immune system and the evolution and mutation of the HIV in their bodies, thereby showing which genetic characteristics help to fight the virus.
The statistics generated to date have resulted in the creation of an experimental vaccine, which is expected to go into trials within six months.
``If everything works out, we may have effective results in two years.''
Mobile ally -- Until an effective vaccine against Aids is found, patients must take their antiretroviral medication according to a strict timetable.
However, this is not always entirely complied with.
An experience conducted in Peru with HIV patients, coordinated by the researcher Walter Curioso from the Cayetano Heredia Peruvian University, who is also an assistant professor at the University of Washington in the US, showed that mobile phones can help patients to comply with their prescribed treatment.
``Even when the drugs are provided free of charge, 88% of the patients don't treat themselves for various reasons,'' he said.
The main reason alleged for not complying with the treatment is forgetfulness, as the patient must take several types of medication during the course of the day.
Living far away from healthcare centers and concern about discrimination if they are identified as having the virus were the other reasons mentioned.
As mobile phones have become indispensable for most people, the research group decided to resort to SMS (short message service) messages to get the patients to stick to their treatment.
Thus, they found an innovative use for a common device.
``Patients were interested not only in getting a reminder to take their medication, but also in something motivating, like `now it is time for your life','' the researcher explained.
The phrase works like a code, in that it protects the patient's privacy.
The qualitative research study was conducted with 20 men and 6 women with HIV, who assessed the SMS messages system positively.
The experience led to the Cell Pos Project, which sends messages to the registered participants and which was developed by the Peruvian university in collaboration with the American university and with Microsoft Research support.
Similar programs for aiding healthcare have been employed successfully in developing nations such as Botswana, South Africa and the Philippines.
``In the Philippines, there was a 90% increase in compliance with treatment among people with TB who got messages via their mobile phones,'' he said.
Prevention system -- In Brazil, a research group coordinated by professor Jacques Wainer, from the Computer Science Institute at the State University of Campinas (Unicamp), is working on developing a system to detect changes in images at the back of the eye that indicate some degree of diabetic retinopathy, a disease that can lead to blindness.
Diabetes affects the passage of blood through the retina, because the local veins and arteries are weakened, causing hemorrhages and scars that interfere with vision.
The project, approved in 2008 under the second call for projects released by the Microsoft Research-FAPESP Institute of IT Research, proposes to make it easier to screen patients that should undergo specialized tests.
Since 2007, when the Institute was created, the two institutions have invested more than R$3.5 million in 11 Brazilian projects in the fields of health, education, digital inclusion, agriculture, e-government, biodiversity, bioenergy and global climate changes.
The research of Wainer's group is resorting to an uncommon technique to process medical images, based on discovering points with significant color and texture changes.
``The points where there was a color or texture change are equivalent to a word,'' said Wainer.
The idea is that each type of point should represent ``words'' in these images.
Each image has, on average, 300 such points.
Based on these visual words, the research follows two different lines.
One of them works with each type of retina anomaly, based on 8 thousand previously classified images.
``The most frequent images in our data set concern the exudate, a liquid with high protein content that is produced in reaction to the damage of tissues and blood vessels,'' said Wainer.
With this method, one discovers that visual words indicate better the presence of exudates in the image.
``It's a fairly precise technique, but it's slow, because it has to be adapted to each of the various types of anomalies that may appear in diabetic retinopathies.''
The system has 90% sensitivity, i.e., 10% of false negatives in the detection of exudates.
The other line of this research project tries to discover the visual words that distinguish which are the normal images and the abnormal ones, without having to look for particular anomalies such as exudates or microaneurisms.
The system should be fully ready in the first half of 2011.
``One of the project's main objectives, from the social point of view, is to create low-cost data communication infrastructure, to link the farms and the co-op, thereby providing the farms with Internet access,'' said Claudia.
The project involves computer science and agrarian science researchers.
The new software programs that are being created will cross and treat the data supplied both by sensors installed in the field, which are to measure variables such as temperature, humidity and luminosity, and by satellites, which are to provide information such as biomass or conditions of the vegetation.
With the computing tools developed, experts should be able to plan production chain activities better, optimize resources and therefore help small farmers perform their tasks.
The producers may also take part in the decision-making process, using the data communication network, supplying information for the experts (the co-op, in this case), and giving and getting feedback on the data.
``This is the two-way road in the project title, meaning that the farmer not only gets information, but plays an active role in the entire process of generating knowledge to improve his work,'' said Claudia.
E-Farms already has several modules in operation and others are to be integrated this very year.
``The project has enabled the training of researchers in a multidisciplinary task and training several master's degree and doctoral students.''
Two of the key challenges of the project, which ended on May 31, but which is to continue with Cooxupé financing, are yet to be overcome.
The first is reproducing on some of the co-op farms the data communication network infrastructure tested within Unicamp's controlled environment.
``This involves surveying the land, specifying the infrastructure, and determining where to place the antennae and collection points.''
The second challenge is to continue to collect and process the sensors' data, showing the results collected in the network in different ways.
``The collected data can already be viewed in real time on the Web, in graph form.
Now we want to take the research forward, including the use of maps,'' said Claudia.
At present, the work involves testing the network in four properties that are difficult to get to.
Based on the results of this stage, the co-op will be able to estimate the costs of implantation on a larger scale, potentially reaching 14 thousand properties.

Vegetable code
A system to identify fruit and vegetables automatically
Evanildo da Silveira
The time it took a supermarket cashier in the city of Campinas to find the code of fruits and vegetables on a printed list drew the attention of IT professor Anderson de Rezende Rocha, from the State University of Campinas (Unicamp).
Whereas products with barcodes on the packaging were rung up quickly, the identification of the vegetables slowed the line down.
That was when he had the idea of developing a system to distinguish bulk produce sold by weight, which involves products that are difficult for a check-out electronic reader to identify because they have no code.
The solution found by Rocha along with researchers Daniel Hauagge, Jacques Wainer and Siome Goldenstein, also from Unicamp's Computer Science Institute, was to develop a system with a camera on the check-out scale to analyze the images of the product to be classified.
The software program that the researchers developed can tell the various produce items apart based on the combination of the characteristics of each.
Rocha explains that the camera only captures the product's image.
The information is extracted by a system using algorithms (mathematical calculations) to process the images and recognize patterns.
Although it may sound complicated, the functioning of the invention, which Rocha developed during his doctorate, under the guidance of professor Siome Goldenstein and with a FAPESP grant, is simple.
It involves two stages: training and testing.
During the training, several images of the products sold in the supermarket are supplied to the system in such a way that it can identify the descriptive characteristics of each.
This is done by identifying the specifications of each type of fruit or vegetable.
``Then, each type of product is trained [compared] to another one, rather than doing them all in one go.''
The system uses a method that divides the problem of classifying many different products into smaller, more manageable problems.
``This can be better understood if one considers a situation with three classes, such as three different types of fruit, for instance, oranges, apples and pineapples,'' says Rocha.
This is done for the several combinations of products, taken two at a time: ``orange vs.
Several other possibilities may exist.
For example, the system might be trained to compare one type of product against all the others.
Candidates on the scale -- When the system starts operating, the testing phase begins.
With each image captured and supplied for classification, the program extracts the same set of characteristics.
They are compared to those previously stored in the training stage.
With this, the system can provide the cashier with a list of probable candidates for a particular fruit or vegetable.
After the employee confirms which one it is, it is only necessary to check the product's price per kilogram and multiply by the weight.
This way of solving the problem is the system's chief innovation, which has led to a patent request being submitted to INPI, the National Institute of Industrial Property.
According to Rocha, the currently available systems are different and less precise.
For example, there is a system called VeggieVision in the United States .
``This system extracts the background, identifies the size of the objects regardless of how many there are and compares this with the references,'' explains Rocha.
``It is based on properties of color, texture and density, which demands extra information from the scale.''
Comparing the ratio of right answers, the Brazilian system beats VeggieVision.
``The ratio of correct answers produced by the American program, showing the four most likely products to the cashier, is 95%,'' says Rocha.
``Ours, however, showing the two most likely products, is 99%.''
According to Rocha, a fuller comparison should also take other factors into account.
Yet another VeggieVision disadvantage is that it incorporates into the data purchasing equipment special mechanisms to deal with variations of lighting and the suppression of the reflections caused by light on the scales and on the plastic bags.
In a real setting, such mechanisms may make it more expensive for the supermarket to adopt the product.
The next step will be to develop a physical prototype.
For the time being, what has been developed is a software program and algorithms that identify fruit and vegetables.
To test this system's efficiency, Rocha and his team used a digital camera to capture 2,633 images of 15 different species, including onions, oranges, limes, watermelons, pears, apples, cashews, kiwis and potatoes, displayed for sale in the Campinas Supply Center (Ceasa).
``At present we are negotiating a partnership with an American company to give continuity to the project,'' Rocha reveals.
The objective now is to improve the stages of separation among varieties in the same type of product, making the system able to tell two different types of bananas apart, such as the nanica (dwarf Cavendish banana) and the prata, for instance.
Additionally, the researchers would like to incorporate a learning process into the operation, i.e., they want the system to learn each answer confirmed by the cashier, in order to further improve the quality of future classifications.
``The last stage of the project will be to integrate our system with those already running in the supermarkets based on barcodes and connected to the invoice printers,'' explains Rocha.

Research discusses the polemic banzo issue as the ``mortal nostalgia'' of slaves
Carlos Haag
``With the shadow grows the enormous aspect / Of the baobab / and the shadow expands an immense sadness in the soul, immensely...'' wrote the Parnassian poet Raimundo Correia in his sonet ``Banzo.''
According to the researcher, a historical analysis of the illness reiterates the need to get rid of the simplified explanations of slaves' ailments -- whether banzo or its extreme form, suicide -- as the result of ``captivity-driven despair,'' a formula employed in the nineteenth century to disguise the violent nature of the relationship between slaves and their masters.
In the history of banzo, therefore, various historical paths meet: stories concerning psychopathology, the transatlantic traffic of slaves, and illnesses.
``The illness always appears in a dual position: it is a clinical entity, a variation of European nostalgia in the tropics, associated with other diseases of the blacks; at the same time, however, it is not dissociated from the political debates about black slavery,'' notes the researcher.
According to Bluteau's Vocabulario [Vocabulary], from 1712, a game is banzo-like when neither of the parties win, an annoying non-definition.
``The history of banzo reminds one of such a game, slaves versus masters, life versus death, in a long and tense struggle.''
Oddly enough, the banzo concept originated from a European formulation about nostalgia as an illness.
This melancholic state was supposedly an indisposition caused by being away from home that then turned into a mortal illness.
Even the famous Phillipe Pinel focused on this subject in Encyclopédie méthodique.
``Certainly, the postulates put forth by the various military physicians and other scientists were extended to the enslaved Africans.
Thus, one may regard banzo as an application of the nostalgia concept developed in Europe,'' says the author.
``His work was the first publication in Portuguese to center on slaves' health and is the chief source of nineteenth century banzo descriptions,'' says Ana Maria.
Highlighting the links between mortal illnesses and the terrible treatment of the captives, Oliveira Mendes stresses that despite being barbarians, the Africans were sincere and constant in their affections.
Banzo is presented as an ``extremely serious illness, caused by the exacerbation of the feeling of nostalgia.''
This image of banzo as the result of the cruelty of slave traffic was extended into the first half of the nineteenth century and was incorporated into travel narratives, tropical medicine books and medical theses.
``It is the vocation of banzo to be a type of `illness-argument,' mobilized in the struggle against slavery,'' recalls the author.
Sigaud, in Do clima and das doenças do Brasil [Climate and diseases of Brazil] (1844), released for the first time in Portuguese this year by the Fiocruz publishing house, considered banzo a mental illness, a variant of nostalgia-melancholia unleashed by moral issues such as nostalgia for Africa or resentment of unfair punishment.
As for Martius, in Natureza, doen¬ças, medicina e remédios dos indigos brasileiros [Nature, illnesses, medicine and remedies of the Brazilian Indians] (1844), he compares the banzo of the blacks and of the Indians, stating that in both melancholia reigned as the cause of death, except that the blacks seemed to experience painful feelings more deeply than the indigenous peoples, as the latter were supposedly cold and distant, as opposed to the Africans, emotional and passionate.
Joaquim Manuel de Macedo, in his monograph on nostalgia, written in 1844 (the same year in which his novel A moreninha was published) as a thesis presented to the Medical School in Rio de Janeiro for him to take on the title of doctor, regarded banzo as a mental illness due to nostalgia for the homeland; its site was the brain.
``Identified with the class of the masters, the romantic writer showed no sympathy whatsoever for slaves, but felt that the blacks' nostalgia was worthy of study, as he considered it a potential threat to the domestic economy,'' reports the researcher.
Besides them, other foreigners addressed the issue of voluntary death among slaves in the nineteenth century: Debret, Henry Koster, Rugendas, Thomas Ewbank, Robert Walsh, and F.
Dabadie, among others.
``After this interest, banzo would remain almost forgotten until the 1930s and 1940s, when the so-called Afro-Brazilian studies recovered it as a subject of research.
It was regarded as something real, a slightly mysterious illness, but not very problematic,'' the author tells us.
Home -- Even a new etymology appeared for the word: banzo was supposedly derived from quimbundo mbanza or villages, thus meaning ``nostalgia for the village'' and, by extension, for home.
``The word's African origin seems a little uncertain to me.
In Bluteau's Vocabulario, for example, the verb banzar is listed as the action of `bewildering with pain,' while banzeiro is something `unquiet, insecure.'
Some believe that the word is of Portuguese origin.''
In 1933, the concept re-emerged in the final pages of the book Casa-Grande & Senzala [The Masters and the Slaves] (1933) by Gilberto Freyre, whose views underscored the modern references to the word: ``The life of the blacks was not entirely cheerful.
There were those who committed suicide by eating soil or hanging or poisoning themselves.
Banzo, the nostalgia for Africa, did away with many of them.
There were some that were so heavily afflicted with it that they became damaged, idiots,'' wrote Freyre.
In 1939, medical views of the illness started appearing, such as that of the parasitologist Manoel Augusto Pirajá, who stated that banzo was a type of sleeping sickness, the African trypanosomiasis, a hypothesis that has since been rejected.
The historiographic production of the 1960s and 1970s, contesting that which has been called ``the myth of mild slavery,'' as put forth by Freyre, emphasized the violent nature of the relations between masters and slaves and gave banzo a new meaning.
Suicides would therefore indicate individual rebellion, in the same way as the quilombos [villages of runaway slaves] and the insurrections denoted collective rebellion,'' explains the researcher.
According to her, however, whether from Freyre's point of view or whether from this more engaged one, little room was given to the subjective factors involved in the actions of the historical individuals.
Thus, suicide in captivity can also be seen, though not exclusively, as a form of protest or escape, always taking into account the complexity of the captivity experience and the human capacity to discover ways of living under adverse circumstances.
``Ascribing to the condition of captivity the motivation for death is a simplistic approach.
Suicidal acts are extreme manisfestations that cannot be reduced to a single explanation, whether sociological, anthropological or psychopathological,'' says the historian Saulo Veiga Oliveira, who analyzed the issue in the article ``O suicídio de escravos em São Paulo'' [The suicide of slaves in São Paulo], published in the journal História, Ciências, Saúde -- Manguinhos.
``Suffice it to see that the high suicide ratio among slaves in the last two decades of slavery is generally attributed to `the despair of captivity,' as a reaction to the servile condition.
However, there are many other reasons: problems with the Law or fear of the punishments imposed by the master.''
Murders -- ``The ratio of `voluntary deaths' among slaves, as compared to that of free men, was two to three times higher and generally ascribed to banzo,'' states the historian Renato Pinto Venâncio, from the Federal University of Ouro Preto and author of Ancestrais: uma introdução à história da África Atlântica [Ancestors: an introduction to the history of Atlantic Africa] (Editora Campus).
``However, like all testimonies from the past, this must be taken with a pinch of salt: the suicide records might conceal murders carried out by the masters.
This does not imply reducing the stature of banzo as one of the tragic expressions of the madness shared by millions of people that were slave traffic victims.
Divulging this suffering in the newspapers must have helped to form the abolitionist sensibility in the imperial society.
Hence the understanding of banzo as an unintentional form of political protest, a primary example of the struggle for non-violence.''
The figures might conceal other motivations.
``Free men hid their affairs, trying to avoid moral and religious sanctions, which barred burial in cemeteries; this might explain the high number of slave deaths,'' explains the historian Jackson Ferreira, from the Federal University of Bahia and author of the article ``Por hoje se acaba a lida: suicídio escravo na Bahia (1850-1888)'' [The drudgery is over for the day: the suicide of slaves in Bahia (1850-1888)].
``Suicidal acts were more than an expression and a mechanism of despair; they were ways of negotiating better conditions, of resisting the conditions of captivity or of freeing oneself from them, definitely abandoning this `land of the living,' as the slave Timóteo wrote in his suicide note.''
Ana Maria Oda is currently researching the curious ``suicide by ingestion of soil'' often mentioned by travelers, in the project Geofagia and escravidão [Geophagy and slavery], financed by CNPq (the National Scientific and Technological Development Council) and connected to the Group of Research into Slavery, Race and Health, headquartered in Oswaldo Cruz House, Fiocruz.
``The pica (change of eating habits to include eating soil or clay, i.e., geophagia, lime, wood, etc.) is interpreted as a deliberate action taken toward death, a slow suicide method of the black slaves,'' says the researcher.
Debret depicted slaves with an iron mask attached to avoid this.
``Geophagia as suicide does not make sense.
Its consequences for health, whether good or bad, haven't been determined.''

Songs that go on for ever
The tango, the bolero and the fado remain alive thanks to electronic media
Joselia Aguiar
In the past, there were the 78 rpm record and the radio; then vinyl; and today, the CD and MP3.
The medium may change, but certain songs, though old, remain.
These include Carinhoso, by Pixinguinha, I've got you under my skin, by Cole Porter, or Por una cabeza, by Carlos Gardel and Alfredo Le Pera.
Music genres that were forgotten for decades have come back, such as the tango.
Furthermore, certain interpretations, though connected to a specific time, will always be remembered.
Might there be one or several shared traits that ensure their survival?
``There are songs that refuse to die,'' she says.
Her project A canção das mídias: memorial e nomadismo [The song of the media: memory and nomadism], its current name, is being conducted at the Musimid center, which is part of the Music Department at the School of Communication and Arts at the University of São Paulo.
And what might a ``song of the media'' be?
This is the concept that Heloísa Valente resorts to in order to define a type of song that is different from all the others that preceded it because it dictates different circumstances of hearing and performance.
It may seem obvious, because it is the song we know.
However, this type of song is recent, if one recalls that radio and phonographic recordings are only about one century old.
``The song is the musical genre most often found in the media, ever since the latter came into being; and the presence of songs is increasing.
Songs from the media can be what one calls `urban popular music,' but it also includes, for example, opera arias and even traditional songs,'' explains the researcher.
In over a decade of documentation and analysis of collected material, the project `The song of the media` has found some answers.
The first is that yes, there is a musical structure that favors permanence.
``Songs with greater complexity often allow arrangers, musicians and singers to make changes, ranging from the most subtle to the most drastic,'' explains the researcher.
In other words, the more elaborate the song, the more it can be renewed.
According to her, this complexity is found in elements such as harmonic density, melodic profile, rhythmic formulation and other elements of musical form.
Nevertheless, not only the more musically complex works survive.
``The hit parade `fads' mean that the songs that are successful in a given genre become known in others,'' says Heloísa Valente.
One such example is the samba Vingança, by Lupicínio Rodrigues, which became Venganza in tango form, reworked in keeping with the taste of the inhabitants of Buenos Aires.
Caminhemos, by Herivelto Martins, was also a hit parade success in its Hispanic version, Caminemos, performed by Trio Los Panchos.
``Success is the reason behind the creation of new versions,'' reiterates the researcher.
Today, it is common for songs to reappear in techno format, the current style.
In the genres she studies, she found not only the electrotango, but also the electronic fado, in which the source recordings are manipulated electro-acoustically.
The survival of songs may also result from a trait that the researcher called ``performance authority.''
In other words, there are singers or, less often, composers and writers of the words who become famous thanks to certain hits and this combination of performer plus song furthers its presence in the sound landscape.
Emoções, by Roberto and Erasmo Carlos, is one such example.
It is in this category that she also includes performers and songs such as Frank Sinatra and I've got you under my skin, Yves Montand and Feuilles mortes, Nat King Cole and Stardust.
They established themselves as standards underscored by the voices of those who performed them.
Songs also stick in the mind of a larger or smaller community because of their symbolic links, as the musicologist explains.
In Portugal, Grândola, vila morena, a traditional song composed and sung by Zeca Afonso, was the password for the startup of the Carnation Revolution in 1975.
In Brazil, O bêbado e o equilibrist, by João Bosco and Aldir Blanc, as sung by Elis Regina, established itself as the symbol of political détente in the early 1980s.
Soon thereafter, Coração de estudante, by Milton Nascimento, became associated with the Diretas-já [Elections now] campaign, with Tancredo Neves [president-elect of Brazil who died before taking office] and with Brazil's return to democracy.
``In these cases there are memorable events of sociocultural origin that end up transforming these works into `places of memory,' in the sense advocated by the historian Pierre Nora.
In one way or another, they have become history.
In most cases, the connection lies directly in the words of the song, in the message that it conveys,'' she adds.
Finally, calendar and festive rituals also have their own repertoire that crosses generations: Holy night, by Gruber, and Máscara negra, by Zé Ketti, connected with Christmas and Carnival, being linked to Christmas and Carnival respectively.
There is still much to study, says Heloísa Valente, who has centered the research mainly on the tango and the fado.
As a result, she published As vozes da canção na mídia [The voices of songs in the media] (Via Lettera/Fapesp, 2003), edited Música e mídia: novas abordagens sobre a canção [Music and media: new approaches to the song] (Via Lettera; Fapesp, 2007), Canção d'Além-mar: o fado e a cidade de Santos [Song from overseas: fado and the city of Santos ] (Realejo/ CNPq, 2008); Canção d'Além-mar: o fado na cidade de Santos: sua gente, seus lugares [Song from overseas: fado in the city of Santos : its people, its places] (Realejo/ FAPESP, 2009) and produced the documentary Canção d'Além-mar: o fado na cidade de Santos, pela voz de seus protagonistas [Song from overseas: fado in the city of Santos , through the voice of its protagonists] (2008).
She is in the final stages of preparing Donde estás, corazón?
O tango no Brasil, o tango do Brasil [Where are you, heart?
Of the three genres, the bolero is the one where the survey and analysis still require further work.
The study of the three genres based on their ``nomadic'' nature -- a concept based on Paul Zunthor (1915-1995), a Swiss scholar who produced important works on this theme -- is one of the major challenges in the current phase of the research.
Each genre ``travels'' and takes on new features, sometimes different and simultaneous styles.
For instance, the tango, the origin of which is still unclear despite the efforts of the many people who have studied it, contains elements of the Cuban habanera and of flamenco, blended with the tradition of the gaucho payadores [singing poets].
It is a genre typical of a specific Argentine region, the estuary of the River Plate, the area between Montevideo and Buenos Aires.
Thus, Argentine musicians travelled to Paris to record their tunes and to tour the neighboring cities with their music and dance.
The bands dressed up in gaucho gear and gave Spanish titles to the compositions.
Soon the tango started being written with words in the local language, such as French, German and Greek.
From the 1930s to the 1940s, the big bands achieved hits with a new type of tango.
The style of singing and dancing changed, with modern or hybrid arrangements.
Hollywood films that showed the tango contributed to the dissemination of a stereotyped view of it as passionate, sensual and extravagant music.
This influence eventually spread to all the Berlin cabarets: this is what one sees in Josef von Stern¬berg's classic, The Blue Angel.
From Europe, it crossed over to North America and the Far East.
In some cases, Brazilians wrote the words and the tunes in keeping with the signature style of the Buenos Aires tango.
There is, however, a tango variation that appeared in Brazil and that developed further, according to the researcher: it was influenced by the habanera, which, in turn, blended with the polka and the lundu.
Some say that the Brazilian tango and the maxixe [a type of Brazilian dance] designate the same musical genre, the word ``tango'' being used to attenuate the lascivious tone of the maxixe.
One of its main researchers, however, the musicologist Luiz Heitor Correia de Azevedo, author of the classic 150 anos de música no Brasil (1800-1950) [150 years of music in Brazil (1800-1950)] wrote that the maxixe is not a musical genre, but a type of choreography.
In its Brazilian origins, the first tango was Olhos matadores (1871), by Henrique Alves de Mesquita, according to the researcher and composer Bruno Kiefer, author of Música e dança popular: sua influência na música erudita [Popular dance and music: its influence upon erudite music].
During that very same decade, Chiquinha Gonzaga created several highly successful Brazilian tangos.
``These data prove that the Brazilian tango precedes the Argentine one -- which implies the existence not of the tango, but of tangos.
Fado is yet another genre with a strong ``nomadic'' characteristic.
Though it is currently the visiting card of Lisbon when it comes to sound, it was born in Brazil, according to José Ramos Tinhorão, the author of several works on Brazilian popular music that have become classics.
Amália Rodrigues, the first lady of the fado, recorded for the first time in Rio de Janeiro, in 1945.
Santos was the city that this aspect of the project ``The songs of the media'' focused on, because it is the one that is home, proportionally speaking, to the largest number of Portuguese immigrants in the country and it is where fado, to this day, is strong.
Thus, one has ``pure fado'' that is incessantly recomposed by the inclusion of new words, new ways of performing it -- the ``styling'' of fado writers-singers, the improvisations, and the circumstances surrounding live performances.
In her study, the researcher investigated how fado gave rise to several ramifications -- fado mix, working-class fado, song-fado -- creating new audiences, new arrangements and new themes.
The immigrant fado, however, has a different life, as the musicologist explains: among most of the Portuguese community in Santos and in other parts of Brazil, fado continued being heard and performed as a link with the home country.
``This nomadic song established an imaginary bridge linking the Portuguese immigrants to their home country,'' states Heloísa Valente.
Thus, fado survives thanks to factors of emotive, memorialistic and intellectual order.
This permanence is also tied to the type of experience of its audience in the place in which it finds itself.
``The reception of the immigrant, at least up to pre-Internet times, was different.
For these communities, fado, like other genres, is experienced, recalled, reconstituted, the more traditional versions being their reference,'' states the researcher.
The most surprising thing is that the phonographic recordings have become a sort of ``score to be read through careful listening.''
The importance of media such as the shortwave radio, the record and the cinema for the consolidation of the genre can also be seen in the history of the bolero in Brazil.
It became very successful as from the 1920s, Augustín Lara (1897-1970) being the first Mexican artist to perform in Brazil.
Jairo Severiano, author of important works on the history of Brazilian popular music, such as the tomes of A canção no tempo [Song over time], states that this triggered a period of Mexicanization of the Brazilian culture.
``We still have to advance in the study of the bolero; this is the new phase of our research,'' says Heloísa Valente.

Uncertainty with regard to an extraordinary feat
Mariluce Moura -- Editor-in -Chief
I was very tempted to put on the cover of Pesquisa Fapesp this month the news about the first artificial organism in the world, thus breaking one of the editorial norms of the magazine since publication started: using only themes linked to Brazilian scientific production as the cover story.
The feat of the team led by famous businessman and researcher, Craig Venter, which was heralded to the whole world on May 20, made me highly enthusiastic, given the infinite possibilities that knowledge has of always surprising, fascinating and, from time to time, even profoundly revolutionizing the way we live.
The enthusiasm of some of my friends, whose vision of the advance of science I have had the greatest respect for over the years, raised my own spirits.
And finally, the cover of the normally sober British periodical, The Economist, supplied me with yet another powerful argument for succumbing to the temptation of the exception: there it was, not the God of Creation almost touching the man-creature with his finger, from the famous painting by Michelangelo Buonarroti on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, but the man-creature, a laptop on his knees, using the energy from his finger to make bacteria-creature.
A fantastic, visual narrative synthesis!
The title, ``And man made life,'' followed by the explanation in the sub-headline, ``The first artificial organism and its consequences,'' left no doubt about how the Economist will apply its prestige to this very significant research which has resulted in the first organism controlled by an artificial genome, created by a computer.
All this enthusiasm, however, is not enough to extinguish the profound uncertainty that is undoubtedly going to last for a long time as to the true dimension, the technological, epistemological or ontological status, let's call it, of the discovery of Venter and his colleagues.
Is it, over and above the unquestionable ``qualitative technological leap that certainly deserves our applause,'' as Mayana Zatz says on Page 47 of this issue , something of a revolutionary nature only in media terms?
Or is it much more than this?
Strictly speaking, we do not know.
The achievement is unquestionably important, even fantastic, but there are still doubts that need to be dispelled before I feel comfortable about choosing the exception rather than following the rule for our covers.
Since I have almost used up the whole of the letter space, I am going to allow myself to draw attention to just one more report, precisely the cover story that was written by journalist, Salvador Nogueira.
Starting on page 16, it deals with the work of a group from USP in Ribeirão Preto that has managed to characterize the type of damage that inflammation associated with sepsis causes in cardiac cells and also to outline a promising path for protecting the heart and in this way have the body gain time to retake control of the complicated sepsis situation; in other words, basic research and applied research.
Just as a reminder: in sepsis, a generalized infection caused by bacteria or a virus, the organism launches an all out desperate attack against its own cells.
When the heart is the organ most affected the death rate is 80%, compared with 20% in a sepsis situation without heart damage.
That is why defending the heart is a fundamental step in the fight against sepsis.

The synthesis of creation
First organism controlled by an artificial genome proves that DNA really is the chemical recipe of life
Marcos Pivetta
When on the 20th of last month the American scientist Craig Venter announced the creation of the first strain of viable cells of a living being controlled by a genome entirely synthesized in a laboratory, he did not economize words to describe the achievement.
He reminded everyone that never before in the history of the world had a creature been presented to mankind with no ancestors.
No parents.
``It is the first species on Earth to self-replicate whose father is a computer,'' stated the bold researcher-entrepreneur, who became famous a year ago when he headed a private project for the sequencing of the human genome capable of rivaling (and of speeding up) the work conducted by the public consortium.
The allusion to the machine as the bacterium's father is no accident.
After all, the information required to make a genome, in the form of a huge sequence of chemical bases (A, C, T and G) was stored in computers.
In the case of the natural variety of the M. mycoides bacterium, it is a sequence comprised of 1.08 million pairs of bases (with about one thousand genes) , found in its single chromosome.
It was with this chemical recipe that a synthetic copy of the natural DNA of this bacterium was made in a laboratory, following a number of specifications of the team from the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI), founded by Venter.
The genome was not synthesized as a single large sequence of DNA, but rather in more than one thousand small pieces.
The set of fragments was inserted into a yeast, where they were brought together and resumed the form of a chromosome.
Finally, the scientists removed the synthetic genome from the yeast and transplanted it into the cells of another bacterium, Mycoplasma capricolum.
The artificial chromosome managed to take over control of the receptor cells, which then started to produce all the typical M. mycoides proteins.
Two days after the transplant, the cells stopped containing the original M. capricolum DNA (either because it was destroyed or diluted in the replication process) and held only one type of genetic material, the M. mycoides synthetic chromosome.
In this entire operation (see infograph on page 46), only 14 relatively unimportant M. mycoides genes were lost or annulled.
``This is both a philosophical and a technical advance,'' said Venter, summing up, from his point of view, the implications of this undertaking.
The climax of an effort that took US$40 million and almost 15 years of research plus a JCVI team of 24 researchers, including Ham Smith, the 1978 Nobel Prize laureate for Medicine, the emergence of a strain of bacteria with a synthetic genome was praised by scientists worldwide.
Some preferred to rank the work, electronically published in the journal Science, as a major technological feat, a change in the scale of man's capacity to modify the DNA of organisms, but not as a scientific revolution.
Other researchers, even though they acknowledge the technical nature of the undertaking, stressed that the work is indeed relevant for science.
The views of three scientists on this matter is published in articles especially written for the current Pesquisa Fapesp issue (pages 47 to 51).
The biologist Fernando Reinach does not deny the scientific merits of Venter's experiment.
According to him, the work irrefutably proves a concept, namely, that there is nothing special about living matter and that it too is subject to the laws of chemistry and physics.
Just with DNA information, one can recreate a genome and, therefore, a form of life.
``Everybody already knew this in theory, but someone still needed to demonstrate, in practice, this broadly accepted theory,'' states Reinach.
``After the publication of the human genome, Venter's work is the most important to appear.
There is no reason to try and make its importance relative,'' says José Fernando Perez, CEO of Recepta Biopharma and FAPESP's scientific director from 1993 to 2005.
``It crowns a major effort to achieve scientific understanding of DNA.
Major scientific advances don't result from great ideas, but from technological achievements.''
Reinach also stressed a second important point, also of a scientific nature, which emerges from the analysis of the Science article.
To date, life has been seen as a continuum.
All beings descended from other similar organisms that had lived in the past.
``Venter's work shows that life can be interrupted and re-started,'' states Reinach, alluding to the fact that the bacterium has no biological ancestors, but that it is the fruit of a sequence of chemical letters stored in a computer.
The geneticist Mayana Zatz, who coordinates the Human Genome Studies Center at the University of São Paulo (USP), compared the repercussion of Venter's work to a similar event that took place 14 years ago.
``This feat reminded me of Ian Wilmut's cloning of the sheep Dolly, in 1996.
The two spurred a media revolution,'' writes Mayana in an article published on page 47.
Most of the financing of JCVI research studies comes from Synthetic Genomics Inc (SGI), an enterprise established by Venter and which has filed 13 patent requests regarding the methods used in synthetic biology work.
Venter says that the M. mycoides experiment will enable one to design microorganisms that are useful for man and that can, for instance, produce vaccines and biofuel.
Exxon, the oil company, has already committed an investment of US$600 million in SGI for the development of algae that manage to produce ethanol.
According to the geneticist Lygia da Veiga Pereira, from USP, Venter has a lot of work ahead to fully engage in the exercise of synthetic biology.
``The main challenge will be to design a totally new genome and to choose which genes will be used for an organism to perform a given task,'' says Lygia.
Even though the US scientist's efforts may take a while to generate palpable fruit, the mere presence in the research environment of a person such as Venter, who is polemic and provocative, is undoubtedly seen as healthy by some of his peers.
``To understand Venter, I think about the human being as a child, a child left in a very large room called the world.
This child fiddles with everything; sometimes gets burnt when it sticks its finger into a socket, but other times it ends up discovering how to climb a chair to get to the delicious food stored up high,'' writes João Meidanis, from the State University of Campinas (Unicamp), in his article on page 48.

The impact of transforming one life into another
Venter's technological feat spurred a media revolution like that of the cloning of the sheep Dolly in 1996
Mayana Zatz
``Artificial life created'' and ``Science creates the first synthetic cell'' were some of the headlines about Craig Venter's work, which was published in the journal Science, under the heading ``Creation of a bacterial cell controlled by a chemically synthesized genome.''
Actually, this was fine genetic engineering work, but no life was created.
What the researchers did was to transform one life into another one, in this case turning a Mycoplasma capricolum bacterium into another one, Mycoplasma mycoides.
The feat reminded me of Ian Wilmut's cloning of the sheep Dolly in 1996.
The two are comparable in that both spurred a media revolution.
Wilmut transferred the genome taken from a cell -- in this case, from Dolly's mammary gland -- to an ovum with no nucleus and, after implanting this in a uterus, generated a Dolly clone.
Venter transferred the genome of a bacterium into another one that then took on the behavior of the first one.
After all, it is three thousand times smaller.
Still, this took 15 years of work, involved 24 scientists and cost US$40 million.
Far from trivial!
The sequencing of the Mycoplasma mycoides genome was already available in a computer database.
However, to copy the recipe and synthesize an artificial chromosome in a laboratory, the researchers had to use yeasts -- which are also living beings -- that have the capacity to join small DNA segments.
Once the DNA had been synthesized, the next obstacle was how to insert it into another bacterium, making sure that the receiving cell did not destroy the exogenous genome, incorporating it instead as if it were its own.
Undoubtedly, a major feat of genetic engineering.
However, was this a revolution?
A media one, undoubtedly.
The repercussion of Venter's work in the press reminded me of Ian Wilmut's cloning of Dolly in 1996.
You are sure to remember this.
``They are going to clone human beings!
They are playing God.
We must immediately create scientific committees to prohibit human reproductive cloning.''
The media repeated all this constantly.
I remember this clearly, because I was invited to sit on such a committee, in which everybody was terribly concerned about prohibiting human cloning.
I was far less fearful about the risks of making human clones and much more interested in getting embryo stem-cell research approved, which eventually occurred.
Today, 14 years later, nobody talks about human reproductive cloning any more.
However, we are witnessing this all over again, now with the alleged risk of creating ``life in a laboratory.''
The president of the United States, Barack Obama, has already determined that ethics committees should be set up to identify ethical limits and to minimize possible risks.
On the other hand, the pediatrician Carlo Bellieni, in the Vatican daily, L' Osservatore Romano, says that ``this research is genetic engineering work at the highest level, one more step toward replacing part of the DNA, but no life was actually created.''
I agree with him.
What are the future implications?
What might the applications be?
It is difficult to forecast.
In the case of Dolly, the major revolution was discovering that an adult cell can be reprogrammed to become totipotent, which cleared the path toward stem cells research.
As for Craig Venter's strategy for creating a bacterium, it may enable us to improve genetic engineering techniques, or to produce new microorganisms that might be useful to man, such as bacteria that can degrade cellulose or plastic more efficiently, generating new forms of biodegradable fuel.
Or intestinal bacteria to allow us to digest cellulose as well as ruminants do.
Furthermore, it might help to improve genetic therapy techniques, correcting defective genes in patients with genetic diseases.
Another major feat about which little was said was Venter's strategy for keeping the receiving bacterium from destroying the genome of the donor and for getting it to adopt it as if it were its own.
This technology might disclose new paths to keep rejection at bay in the case of allogeneic transplants, or even, perhaps, of xenotransplants.
The future will tell.
Still, one more qualitative technological leap has been taken and it is certainly worthy of applause.

Craig Venter, a necessary good
The scientist is like a naughty boy who is after the tasty tidbits, whether this is completing the human genome as fast as possible or making a bacterium from scratch
João Meidanis
Craig Venter is once again news in journals, magazines and newspapers worldwide, this time because of the article on a bacterial cell guided by a genome that Venter's group synthesized in a laboratory.
This is the most recent chapter in a project that Venter has focused on for over a decade: creating a living being from scratch.
Moreover, there are several competitors chasing after the same thing.
A major discovery?
Or a daring lack of thought, a Pandora's box that might lead us to self-destruction?
The reactions to the article that he published in Science range from unconstrained praise to severe attacks, as always seems to be the case with Venter.
He is that rare type of scientist that makes many uncomfortable, but who, to my mind, is extremely necessary.
First, he is in good company.
His major partner of long standing, Hamilton Smith, or Ham Smith, as he is affectionately known, is a molecular biology genius.
In the article about the first bacterium that was sequenced we see Venter and Smith.
On the executive board of Celera, the enterprise created to compete with the public (but sluggish) project for the sequencing of the human genome, we find Venter and Smith again.
And now, in this recent article, who are the leaders?
Venter and Smith, of course, now accompanied by yet another molecular biology heavyweight, Clyde A. Hutchison III, who joined the team in 2003.
Experts will remember Hutchison as one of the pioneers in the introduction of mutations directed into genomes.
Ham Smith, in turn, won the Nobel Prize many years ago (1978) for his discovery of nothing less than the enzymes of restriction, one of the most basic genome manipulation tools.
Restriction enzymes are to genetic engineering like pencil and paper are to elementary schooling.
To understand Venter, I think about the human being as a child, a child left in a huge room called the world.
The child fiddles with everything and sometimes burns its finger when it pokes a socket, but at other times ends up discovering how to climb onto a chair to reach the delicious tidbits found up top.
Venter is this naughty boy who is chasing after the tidbits, whether these consist of completing the human genome as fast as possible or manufacturing a bacterium from scratch.
Will this unbridled quest lead us to self-destruction?
It might.
However, there seems to be something stronger within us, a curiosity that is so violent that it makes one forget everything.
Of course, there are all sorts of people in the world.
Some have this relentless curiosity, others prefer to be mere spectators of life without fiddling with many things; most, however, stand between these two extremes.
In addition, come to think of it, the human species is not going to last forever, with or without Venter.
Species evolve, some disappear, others appear.
One should embrace a more sober, less passionate view of life.
Although we may have the natural tendency to feel that human beings are central and important to the world, it is more likely that humans are merely just one more species that have come and that will go.
We have already gone through other episodes in which we placed ourselves in an outstanding but undeserved position: we thought that the Earth was the center of the Universe, we thought that God had made us special.
Two major letdowns for mankind, which many people, to this day, refuse to swallow (especially the second one).
Against prohibiting research
Two fundamental roles of science are to expand mankind's knowledge and to discover new technologies.
It is not up to scientists to determine whether these technologies are to be used to save lives, build armaments or for other purposes: this is a decision for society as a whole, generally taken at national level.
In the current world, each country has sovereignty to decide how to use its technologies.
Although there is strong international pressure against uses regarded as damaging, there is at present no multilateral body strong enough to impose its resolutions against the individual wish of countries.
To my mind, it would not be appropriate, as some advocate, to prohibit research along these lines.
From the standpoint of scientific ethics, Venter and his group went by the book: they did not use human beings, did not cause guinea-pigs to suffer unnecessarily and published their results in a journal that has widespread international circulation and that took the decision to make this article available to anyone with web access, regardless of whether or not this person subscribes to the journal.
Thus, everyone can have access to it: researchers, students, terrorists, curious individuals, etc.
So relax, folks.
We are not going to exist forever.
If we are really going to vanish, at least we can try to influence the future a little, in however small a way, as to what the new species to inhabit the Earth will be.

Synthetic biology and bioenergy
How the discovery that it is possible to transfer a genome created in a lab may affect biofuel technologies
Marcos Buckeridge
Imagine if, based on a complete sequence of your genome, you, the reader, could synthesize your own DNA, introduce it into a human cell and then cause this DNA to take over the command of this cell, forming tissues, organs and even an identical copy of yourself to whom you could transfer your memories.
As in Phillip K.
Dick's science fiction novel that gave rise to the script of the movie Blade Runner, it seems that at least one important proof of the viability of this concept has been achieved.
On May 20, the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) published on the website of the journal Science an article in which it reports the activation of the synthetic genome of one microorganism into another one, the bacterium Mycoplasma mycoides.
The measure of success, in this case, was that the synthetic genome acquired control of another cell and that this cell began reproducing in a laboratory.
I heard him say something similar at a talk delivered at the last World Congress of Biotechnology held in Barcelona in 2009.
One of the major challenges we currently face is how to produce bioenergy cheaply and sustainably in environmental terms.
The JCVI discovery opened up a path for researchers to obtain engineered microorganisms that do the work of producing ethanol or biodiesel to an excellent standard.
Here in Brazil, at CTBE, the National Bioethanol Science and Technology Laboratory in Campinas, we are already engineering bacteria and fungi with enzymes that attack the vegetable cell wall and that may help in the development of the technological route to second-generation ethanol.
One of the laboratories at INCT (National Institute of Bioethanol Science and Technology ), headed by the researcher Richard Ward, reported at INCT's last workshop, held in April, trials with a chimerical enzyme, i.e., an artificially assembled protein that can attack two components of the cell wall, lignin and hemicellulose, at the same time.
Still, even if we have not achieved anything as spectacular as Venter (yet), Brazilian bioenergy is beginning to enter the synthetic biology era.
There are several paths to choose from and problems to solve using this technology.
One of them is engineering the metabolism of Saccharomices cerevisiae, the yeast we use to make alcohol, in such a way as to enable it to use the five-carbon sugars that come from hemicellulose, something this yeast cannot do very well.
With microorganisms, the synthetic biology applications will became far faster and should yield impressive results.
On the other hand, when it comes to more complex organisms, applications might take rather longer.
Nevertheless, biologist are moving in this direction and they are doing it by gaining an understanding of organisms as complex systems.
A major but still initial step
Inserting a synthetic genome into a cell is undoubtedly an important step in the biology area.
If one considers that a gene corresponds on average to 10 to 15 kbps (1 kbp equals 1,000 DNA bases), what the JCVI group achieved was building a genome of 600 to 1,000 genes, transferring this to a cell whose DNA had been removed, and making this bacterial cell that became the host of the synthetic genome work.
This is sensational technical progress and its implications are huge.
However, the difficulties of applying this to more complex organisms are even greater.
It is likely that in our sugarcane we have roughly the same number of genes as in corn.
However, unlike the Mycoplama mycoides, sugarcane has eight copies of each gene.
This means that there are nominally some 240 thousand genes interacting in the organism's genome and causing it to function perfectly well, to the point of allowing us to make the ethanol that we use to fill our gas tanks.
If the degree of difficulty were linear in relation to genome size, doing with sugarcane what was done with the bacterium M. mycoides would be 400 times harder.
However, there are added difficulties that make this relation even more complex and difficult.
The bioenergy that we need, in part because of our engine technology, is stored in the bonds between carbon atoms and the only way of storing this energy in this way is through photosynthesis.
There are bacteria that can carry out photosynthesis and they are generally ranked among the targets of synthetic biology.
The cyanobacteria, for example, are good producers of lipids that can function as biodiesel, indicating that we can think about setting up industrial systems to produce bionergy using them.
However, there is an important biological reflection to be considered.
If cyanobacteria are that good to produce bioenergy, why is it that to this day civilization has not used them to obtain food and energy?
Why is our food based principally on plants that grow on the land?
One of the answers is that the increase in complexity that resulted from the evolution of multiple-cell beings and the development of increasingly more efficient photosynthesis systems caused plants to take over the planet.
Amongst these, the grass family, such as corn and sugarcane, produced one of the most efficient photosynthesis systems that exist.
They have a photosynthesis system called C4, with which they produce a greater amount of biomass in less time than other plants.
And this is why civilization such as we know it is heavily based on these species.
Synthetic biology is being adopted to alter photosynthesis in plants.
The photosynthesis of soy, for instance, is not as efficient as that of the grass family.
However, an international research group has been outlining strategies for implanting, with the help of synthetic biology, a C4 system in the leaves of this legume.
Venter took a major step, but a lot of investigation and creativity will still be required for us to really break the code of complexity concealed within life.
There is a large number of researchers, even in Brazil, who are turning toward the use of synthetic biology as the main tool for the development of new biotechnologies.
The future promises to be great fun and interesting.

Fear in the air
Biologists identify proteins that indicate the presence of predators to mice
Ricardo Zorzetto
One does not need to teach a mouse or a rat to be afraid of a cat.
No sooner do they start walking than rodents are able to recognize predators' traces in the environment and to realize when it is time to vanish.
After conducting experiments for three years, the Brazilian biologist Fabio Papes and two researchers from the United States presented answers to some of these questions in the May 14 issue of the journal Cell, in an article important enough to be featured on the issue's cover.
Together with Darren Logan and Lisa Stowers, from the Scripps Research Institute in California, Papes, a researcher at the State University of Campinas (Unicamp), conducted a series of tests in which he placed mice in contact with pieces of gauze that had been rubbed on the neck of a cat, moistened with the urine of a rat or rubbed on the skin of a snake - three of the natural predators of mice.
In all cases, just sensing the odor increased the production of stress hormones in the mice and made them more cautious: after just a whiff of the smell of one of the predators, the rodents would start to explore their environment much more carefully.
The organ's importance became evident when the researchers found that genetically modified mice, with a genetic alteration that rendered the vomeronasal organ's neurons inactive, showed no fear when exposed to the smell of rats, snakes or cats.
Both the rodents with active vomeronasal organs and those with deactivated organs avoided the gauze with naphthalene, a sign that the neurons that had been switched off could still play a part in the identification of natural enemies.
``This result indicates that the organ is involved in the detection, if not specific, at least targeted, of the odor of predators,'' says Papes, who teaches at Unicamp's Biology Institute.
As the secretion of animals of different species provoked the same reaction in mice, the researchers suspected that there might be a common compound in the urine of rats, in the mucus on the skin of snakes and in the saliva that cats leave upon their fur after licking themselves.
He got lucky.
He found a protein in cat saliva -- Feld4 -- that is quite similar to the most abundant protein in rat urine, Mup13 (Major Urinary Protein 13).
In a new series of tests, Papes and Darren Logan found that after inhaling solutions that only contained the isolated proteins, the mice were just as cautious as they were after smelling rat urine or cat saliva.
``These proteins worked like kairomones, molecules that the organism of a species releases and that act upon another species, to the loss of the releasing species and to the benefit of the species getting the information,'' explains Papes, who shared with Logan the authorship of the Cell article.
Papes is currently working on identifying the brain circuits activated by these odors.
He believes that using this strategy, in the not too distant future, it will be possible to get a map of the sensory activation associated with behaviors such as the defense, maternal and reproductive ones, among others.
``Knowing how the brain recognizes, interprets and responds to stimuli such as odors,'' he comments, ``may even help us to better understand diseases connected to sensory alterations.''

Halting steps
New studies show how to detect and reduce the risk of falls among the aged
Maria Guimarães
The greatest threat to the health and life of the aged is found within homes and in the streets, especially in the mornings and afternoons.
Falls account for 61% of visits to emergency rooms for those over the age of 60, according to Ministry of Health data from 2007.
Falls are a common drama among the elderly, but they tend to be regarded by the rest of society as inherent to advancing age.
The consequences, however, are too serious for the problem not to be treated as a primordial public health issue.
Around 16% of the falls cause fractures and out of every four elderly people hospitalized for femur surgery, one dies within one year, according to the rheumatologist Marcelo Pinheiro, from the Federal University of São Paulo (Unifesp), one of the coordinators of Brazos, the Brazilian Osteoporosis Study, the first to assess the extent of the problem in Brazil.
Fortunately, a series of studies has been showing that simple exercises can avoid a substantial part of these accidents and truly improve the quality of life during the period that some prefer to call the ``golden years.''
The most serious consequences of falls are due to osteoporosis, the gradual loss of bone density that affects primarily women.
It may be the cause of the fall , when something apparently banal, like a sudden movement, can shatter the femur and cause the person to fall, often without knowing why.
However, in 90% of the cases, the fracture is caused by the fall, rather than vice-versa, according to Pinheiro.
Based on the questionnaires answered in 2006 by 2,420 people aged over 40, the Brazos study evaluated recurrent falls and fractures in 150 cities in Brazil's five regions.
Among the adults interviewed, 15% of the men and 30% of the women who had already suffered fractures had a history compatible with osteoporosis, but 85% of these men and 70% of these women had not been informed about the disease.
``The fracture is often treated without densitometry being conducted in order to evaluate the state of the bones,'' Pinheiro tells us.
Based on the knowledge accrued through other studies and on clinical indications, the Brazos researchers estimate a far greater prevalence of osteoporosis than that reported in the questionnaires, according to articles published recently in Arquivos Brasileiros de Endocrinologia & Metabologia [Brazilian Archives of Endocrinology and Metabology] and in Cadernos de Saúde Pública [Public Health Notebooks].
The problem is even more alarming given the growth estimates for the aged population in Brazil in forthcoming decades.
According to IBGE (the National Geography and Statistics Institute), in 2025, the country will have 35 million inhabitants older than 60, more than 2 million just in the city of São Paulo.
From 2000 to 2050, the forecast is that the percentage of the aged relative to the total population should triple, from 5.1% to 14.2%, as a result of a declining birth rate and longer life expectancy.
For the Unifesp rheumatologist, another important finding concerns nutrition.
Our diet is fairly balanced in terms of proteins, carbohydrates and fats, but it leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to micronutrients and vitamins.
``Brazilians consume 400 milligrams of calcium a day, when the international recommendation is 1,200 milligrams,'' he tells us.
It is a cultural problem rather than a socioeconomic one, given that even the wealthier people in classes A and B have only about half the calcium that they should.
For Pinheiro, an interesting strategy would be to fortify certain foods, as is common in countries such as the United States, or to have micronutrient supplements.
Another important deficiency, directly linked to incorporating calcium into the bones, is vitamin D, abundant in fish such as herring, tuna and salmon, as well as in nuts, almonds and olive oil.
``Eating these foods is a northern hemisphere habit; here, we consume five times less than the daily recommendation, about two micrograms a day.''
``One should expose at least the arms and the neck to the sun for at least 20 minutes a day, with no sunscreen,'' recommends Pinheiro.
The impact of these falls and fractures upon the quality of life is dramatic, as Brazos data show.
What causes death within one year of one quarter of the elderly people who break their femur are the consequences of being hospitalized, such as pressure ulcers, pulmonary embolism and infection.
Staying in hospital can also cause depression, opening the doors to dementia and increasing dependence due to physical limitations.
``It's like a pressure cooker,'' he compares, ``the person was fine and suddenly the fracture causes latent problems to emerge.''
To prevent osteoporosis, it is not enough to treat the elderly.
``It's a geriatric disease whose prevention has to start in childhood, with the right diet and physical activity.''
The Brazos study, which includes adults as from the age of 40, showed that the younger group lacks awareness of the imminent problem and does not take preventive measures.
The chief cause of the accidents that turn thousands of elderly people essentially into invalids each year, according to Pinheiro, is lack of knowledge.
Besides prevention, which should include stopping smoking and drinking too much alcohol and coffee, there are now effective treatments for safeguarding bone density.
Osteoporosis and the likelihood of falling are not only linked by bad luck -- and understanding this can be crucial in order to prevent fractures.
It is muscular activity that helps to keep the bones healthy.
``We believe that muscle loss takes place along with bone loss,'' conjectures Daniela.
She used electromagnetic sensors to evaluate the balance of women with osteoporosis, with osteopenia (an intermediary bone loss stage) and with healthy bones and found that the more fragile the bones, the greater the instability.
``The weakness of specific muscle groups causes different types of instability,'' explains Daniela.
Even after losing a bit of bone mass, women with osteopenia already evidence a forward and backward oscillation similar to the one found among those who suffer from osteoporosis and greater than that of women with no bone problems.
As the bones degrade, muscles also lose mass, giving rise to a vicious circle.
According to the sensors, the women with osteoporosis not only oscillate forward and backward, but from side to side as well.
The next step, according to Daniela, is to establish in detail what the most heavily affected muscle groups are in order to design specific training programs for recovery.
While this map of weakened muscles is not provided in detail, the group of rheumatologist Rosa Pereira, from the Medical School of USP's São Paulo campus, showed that physical exercise for improving balance, besides reducing the incidence of falls, is also effective in improving several elements, such as wellbeing, physical functions and social interaction.
During her doctoral research, the physiotherapist Melisa Madureira developed a method to improve the balance of osteoporosis patients.
With a series of simple exercises, such as walking forward, sideways, raising one leg and the opposite arm, on tiptoe and on the heels -- for 30 minutes once a week, along with stretching and walks, she managed to improve the quality of life and to reduce the incidence of falls among the 30 patients in her experimental group relative to the 30 control patients who did not undergo this training, according to the article already available on the website of the journal Maturitas.
The participants in the study were also given an instruction booklet in order to do the exercises at home, further improving results.
``Contrary to body building, which calls for individual instructor attention, for this type of exercise constant supervision is unnecessary.
``It's useless to provide osteoporosis medication without reducing falls, because the fractures continue to happen,'' she adds.
Indeed, there is no point in only focusing on osteoporosis, as countless factors can lead to falls.
A study coordinated by the epidemiologist Evandro Coutinho, from the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), compared 250 cases of falls treated in five Rio de Janeiro hospitals with 250 control cases of people of a similar age, sex and type of residence, and indicated a low index of body mass, a cognitive deficit, strokes, urinary incontinence, use of benzodiazepine medication and muscular relaxants as risk factors for falls that lead to serious fractures, according to an article published in 2008 in BMC Geriatrics.
The group did not take osteoporosis into account because diagnosing the disease was not routine in the selected hospitals.
``The most surprising thing was detecting the effect of muscle relaxants,'' Coutinho tells us, as ``most of the studies don't take this type of medication into account.''
These drugs, often prescribed to alleviate the back pains of the elderly, may quadruple the risk of falling.
As for the benzodiazepines, they are tranquilizers usually prescribed for those who have trouble sleeping.
The problem is that they cause dizziness, sleepiness and diminish muscle strength and contraction, doubling the risk of falls and fractures.
``The aged have slower metabolism, so that when they wake up, they are still under the medication's effects,'' explains the epidemiologist, who was also surprised to find that most of the accidents occur in the mornings and afternoons and not, as he had expected, during the night, in the dark, when the person gets up to go to the bathroom.
According to him, before prescribing these kinds of drugs for the elderly, physicians should research better the cause of the pains and sleeping difficulties first, instead of merely treating the symptoms.
Moreover, he adds, there are now benzodiazepines that are more suitable for the aged, as they last less time in the organism.
``Out of every 100 old people, 30 will fall in any given year,'' Coutinho assesses.
However, the risk is greater for those that have already fallen: 60% of the elderly that fall and hurt themselves will fall again within one year, according to the data of the SABE (Health, Wellbeing and Aging) project, a study that monitors the conditions of the life and health of elderly residents in the city of São Paulo over time.
``A fall is an indication that the person may fall again,'' comments the physician Maria Lúcia Lebrão, from the School of Public Health at the University of São Paulo (USP), who is the project's coordinator.
For the researcher from the School of Public Health, one must evaluate carefully the causes of the falls in order to correct this.
Many of the aged feel dizzy and lose their balance even when there are no obstacles in the way.
With less muscle strength and slower reflexes, it becomes much harder to correct unstable positions and those incidents of tripping that, during youth, went unnoticed.
To this, one must add environmental factors such as irregular sidewalks, shoes that challenge balance and slippery carpets.
Initiated in 2000 (see Pesquisa Fapesp issue 87), the study in which almost 2,500 people have taken part tracks the aging tendencies of the São Paulo inhabitants and is now entering its third stage.
Two thirds of the interviewees reported at least one fall since their 60th birthday.
The greater the age, the greater the risk of falling, but what is most surprising is that environmental factors pose an even greater risk than age: the elderly that moved recently are more likely to fall within a home with which they are less familiar than those who have lived for a long time in the same place and have already imprinted the potential obstacles in their memory.
The study also showed that an important factor regarding falls is the frailty syndrome, which can either cause falls or result from them.
The syndrome is present when the patient has three out of the following five indicators: loss of weight for no reason, diminishing muscle strength, fatigue, increasingly slow walking speed and a reduction of physical activity.
Yeda Duarte, from USP's Nursing School, has been analyzing this issue in a sub-project of the SABE study that she is coordinating, in collaboration with Maria Lúcia.
Every six months, since 2008, they evaluate elderly people as from the age of 75, alternating home visits with phone interviews.
``Women live longer than men but during these added years many of them may have a worse quality of life, as survival can go hand-in-hand with periods of incapacity,'' comments Maria Lúcia.
According to the research, the São Paulo City population appears to become frail earlier than is the case in developed countries, where the syndrome is more common after the age of 85.
In the USP study, the researchers found that in São Paulo, frailty is sometimes already present at the age of 65.
It will be necessary to include younger elderly in their research in order to better understand how the syndrome has developed in this population.
Frailty per se becomes a severe limitation when the person is not strong enough to keep to a normal routine and takes half an hour to get to the corner of the block.
However, its connection with falls makes it even more serious, especially when these falls result in fractures that demand surgery, hospitalization and immobilization for a longer time, all of which helps to make frailty more severe.
``We must break this cycle,'' sums up Lúcia, who has partnering arrangements with the Ministry of Health and with corresponding bureaus in the state and in the city of São Paulo, in order to help to implant the interventions that can help to avoid or revert frailty, based on the study.
Health club -- One of the main elements that make predisposition to fall more serious is a lack of muscle strength, according to the work of André Rodacki, a biomechanics expert from the Federal University of Paraná (UFPR).
During a regular walk, the researcher explains, the flexibility of the musculature of the hips is essential to improve control over the legs and the strength of the knees' extensor muscles, ensuring larger, firmer steps.
In a study on 20 elderly women doing stretching exercises that targeted the hip area three times a week that was published in 2009 in Gerontology, he showed that four weeks are enough to improve the extent to which people raise their feet, the size of their steps and their walking speed.
This is already a fine step toward reducing the risk of falls, but not the only one.
When one tries to keep a key ring from falling on the floor or trips and tries to regain one's balance, one's muscles must be able to generate strength very fast, explains Rodacki.
Improving this capacity, as he shows this month in Clinical Biomechanics, involves power training for knee muscles, by doing fast movements using a low weight device, a type of exercise rarely suggested for the elderly.
He has been researching more interesting ways of maintaining sound walking capability and good balance.
The problem, which is not limited to bones and muscles, also affects the mind, affecting elderly people's safety.
The fear of falling is part of the day-to-day life of 42% of the men and 60% of the women over 60, according to Brazos results published this in year in Cadernos de Saúde Pública.
``Trust the elderly person's self-evaluation,'' she advises.
Mariana, who works at USP's Department of Physiotherapy, Speech Therapy and Occupational Therapy, also found a clear correlation between the fear of falling, measured by a questionnaire on day-to-day tasks, and cognitive difficulties.
Besides the fear of falling, Mariana found that the educational level has a substantial effect on the risk of falling, as the difficulty in completing the cognitive test indicates.
``The mean level of schooling among the Brazilian elderly is about four years,'' she states.
The study showed that people with fewer years of schooling have more difficulty integrating information, less memory and coordination, and therefore more precarious balance.
Furthermore, the researcher adds, they have lower purchasing power and more limited access to healthcare services and medication, which probably aggravates the problem.
The best solution, according to the physiotherapist, is not to send the aged back to school.
She found that simple exercises that train motor cognitive integration -- doing a movement while also paying attention to some point in the environment, for instance -- help the elderly to become more agile in a short time.
Mariana is planning to implement a system of home visits to help older people absorb the information from their own world.
For her, the proposal is viable, even financially.
``It's far cheaper for the country to make spot interventions once a month than to keep an elderly person hospital with a broken femur.''
One common point seems to bring together the researchers from various areas of specialization when it comes to the mobility and balance of the aged: walking on the streets, with sidewalks full of holes and steps, need not be harder than an obstacle course that includes a sack race.
Simple, effective measures can enable people to recover their vigor and day-to-day pleasure after the age of 60.

The sloth's hidden friend
Mammal's fur is home to a type of symbiotic green algae not found elsewhere in nature
Marcos Pivetta
It is no secret for biologists that the greenish-brown shade of sloths' thick fur is due to the presence of organisms that contain chlorophyll.
Green algae and cyanobacteria (blue algae) hidden in the fur help these slow mammals that live in trees become camouflaged in the woods and to foil their predators.
However, researchers had not imagined that this part of sloths' bodies could be home to such a varied mini-ecosystem.
A phylogenetic study of samples of the fur of 71 animals from the six species of sloths that exist found molecular material from 72 different groups of organisms -- ranging from spiders, moths, beetles and cockroaches to a large number of microbes.
``There were beings that were food producers (algae), consumers (protozoans) and decomposers (fungi),'' states the ecologist Adriano Chiarello, from the Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais (PUC-MG), one of the authors of the study, published on March 30 of this year in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology.
``This was unexpected.''
Another interesting piece of information was the substantial incidence of a group of green algae of the Trichophilus genus, found in the fur of 73% of the analyzed sloths, regardless of the animals' geographic origin.
This piece of data lends substance to the idea that there really is an ancient symbiotic relation between sloths and algae.
This type of mammal only exists in the tropical forests of Central and South America and the animals analyzed in this study came from four countries: Brazil, French Guiana, Costa Rica and Panama.
The researchers believe that a species of green algae, the Trichophilus welckeri, discovered more than 150 years ago, can only be found in sloths' fur.
``The algae was described in 1841 in fur samples of the animals and wasn't documented ever again in other habitats,'' comments Milla Suutari, a Finnish researcher from the University of Helsinki, another author of the study.
``It is probably not found in any other environment.''
If this hypothesis is correct, it is an alga that developed in parallel with the evolutionary history of these solitary tree climbers, perhaps establishing a close relation with their host par excellence.
Source of nutrients -- Sloths' fur really does seem to be a good habitat for algae.
They have grooves and fissures and, unlike the fur of other animals, they absorb water.
Besides providing these mammals with a chromatic means of foiling their enemies, the algae may be a small extra source of nutrients that sloths' skin may absorb by diffusion.
Other hypotheses not yet tested have been put forth to explain this close link between the algae and the sloths.
For instance, the algae might produce substances that make the fur better suited to the growth of beneficial bacteria.
Or they might produce certain types of amino acids that could absorb ultraviolet rays, acting as a sunscreen for the sloths.
The algae of the Trichophilus genus perpetuate themselves among the sloths by probably passing from the mothers to their offspring, once the youngsters have reached a few weeks of life, the study suggests.
Of the 19 animals that lacked the algae, seven were babies.
Perhaps at the time when the fur samples were collected for the study, these young animals had not yet had enough contact with their mothers to acquire the green friend.
There are two sloth genera: Bradypus, which comprises the so-called three-toed sloths, with four species (B.
tridactylus, B. torquatus, B. variegatus and B. pygmaeus); and Choloepus, the two-toed sloths, with two species (C.
didactylus and C. hoffmanni).
The green algae also seem to follow this pattern, as the identified species of Trichophilus in one genus are apparently different from those found in the other genus.
Except for the B. pygmaeus sloth, found only on one Panama island, the other five species are found in Brazil.
One of them, B. torquatus, popularly known as the maned sloth or ai, is under threat of extinction and only lives in the Brazilian Mata Atlântica (Atlantic Seaboard Forest).
Because it is only found in Brazilian forests, it was the sole Brazilian representative in the study about the algae living in sloths' fur.
Though several types of terrestrial algae were identified in the fur of B. torquatus, samples of the Trichophilus genus were not found.
In the C. didactylus, algae of this genus were also not found.
However, as there were samples of fur from only two samples of this species, it was impossible to develop a definitive analysis in this case.

The secret of Perseus
Simulations help to explain the high temperature of the gas found in agglomerations in the galaxy
Salvador Nogueira
A fat old decadent galaxy that seems to have borrowed gas from its neighbors to get back to making stars is helping a group of astronomers decipher the mysteries of agglomerations in the galaxy, the building blocks of the largest structures in the Universe.
Shaped like a flattened sphere, the galaxy lies toward the constellation of Perseus, the mythological Greek hero that decapitated the Medusa, and it is huge: it has 10 to 100 times more matter than the Milky Way, our galaxy, which is comprised of some 200 billion stars, and it keeps others gravitationally captive around it.
Known as the Perseus agglomeration, this group of galaxies has a striking characteristic that has puzzled, for a long time, those who study it: it is permeated by a huge cloud of very rarified hot gas, with some regions being far hotter than one would expect.
The laws of physics dictate that as the gas of the neighboring galaxies is drawn by gravity toward the central galaxy, in this case, NGC1275, which lies at 235 million light-years from the Earth, the gas density should increase whereas its temperature should drop markedly.
``As the gas becomes denser near the center of the agglomeration, the particles that form it collide more easily with each other and lose energy in the form of radiation,'' explains the astrophysicist Elisabete de Gouveia Dal Pino, who has been studying the Perseus agglomeration for the last few years.
Thus, the greater the density and proximity relative to the central galaxy, the colder the gas should be.
However, this is not quite what seems to be happening with Perseus.
This effect can only be explained by something reheating the gas in the agglomeration's more central region, thereby offsetting the heat loss.
For quite some time, researchers have had a candidate for this: a huge black hole whose mass equals that of hundreds of millions of stars like the Sun, situated right in the middle of NGC 1275.
Black holes are such dense and compact objects that nothing can escape their surface, not even light.
However, a lot of energy is released in their vicinity.
Before it is drawn in and absorbed, the matter that spirals around a black hole gains acceleration due to gravity.
Part of it, with the aid of magnetic fields, escapes in two narrow rays that leave the poles of the black hole, giving rise to particle jets that move at a speed close to that of light.
These jets release radio waves that astronomers can detect.
Images produced by X-rays, another type of radiation, showed that the vicinity of the NGC 1275 black hole (the region in space also known as active galactic nucleus because it releases more energy that the rest of the galaxy) released enough energy to keep the gas hot in the more central portion of the agglomeration.
However, there was still a mystery: how could the gas temperatures be more or less homogeneous if the black hole radiation jets were so narrow?
By conducting computer simulations, the group coordinated by Elisabete Dal Pino and Zulema Abraham, researchers from the Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences at the University of São Paulo (IAG-USP), in the São Paulo state capital, found a possible answer.
``The temperatures could be those observed if the active galactic nucleus were in precession [change in the inclination of the rotation axis],'' states Elisabete.
The idea can be translated as follows: to keep the temperature roughly homogenous, it is necessary for the inclination of the rotation axis of the central object to vary and for the jets to fluctuate, thereby distributing energy better.
Or, more simply put, this can happen if the black hole wobbles like a top that is losing speed.
The simulations conducted by Diego Falceta-Gonçalves, from Cruzeiro do Sul University (Unicsul) in São Paulo, yielded similar results to those observed in nature when the angle of oscillation of the axis was great: 60 degrees.
In the Astrophysical Journal Letters article in which the researchers presented their results in early 2010, the issue was explained: as the jets oscillate over time, the released energy is about equal in all directions.
It is as if the radiation rays worked like the beaters in a mixer, mixing the cake's ingredients to turn it into a homogeneous mass.
However, this may not be the only explanation.
In mid-2008, Elisabete Dal Pino was visiting the University of Wisconsin in Madison, in the United States, when the American astronomer John Gallagher showed her a result that he had just obtained and had not yet even published.
Gallagher and his group had taken measurements of the gas filaments around the NGC 1275.
``He was intrigued because they obtained maps of the speeds of the filaments and they realized that some of them were pulling away from the galaxy rather than moving toward it, which is what one would expect,'' the astrophysicist tells us.
The result, published the following year in Nature, was an unexpected measurement.
It indicated that some type of force was offsetting gravity, pushing the gas outward from NGC 1275.
Moreover, magnetic forces were causing the filaments to arch.
It was unlikely that the active galactic nucleus, no matter how powerful it might be, was producing this phenomenon on its own.
So what might be happening?
``That was when I had the idea of supernovas,'' says the Brazilian researcher.
Supernova is the name of a very high mass star that has consumed all its fuel and has exploded.
It is one of the Universe's most energetic events.
A series of supernovas might explain the shape of the filaments around the central galaxy of the agglomeration.
In another series of simulations, this time partnered by John Gallagher and Alex Lazarian, both of them from Wisconsin, Falceta-Gonçalves and Elisabete showed that the falling gas from neighboring galaxies might produce a shock wave on NGC 1275's surface and generate a sudden star formation episode.
Stars with a lot of mass burn their fuel faster than smaller bodies such as the Sun, which take billions of years to be exhausted.
Therefore, there might be a wave of supernova explosions just a few million years after the star formation process.
With the aid of computers, the researchers simulated what would happen 120 million years after the birth of the stars.
The work, also published in Astrophysical Journal Letters, indicated that the interaction of the radiation released by the active galactic nucleus with the turbulences generated by the supernovas produces a pattern of filaments very similar to the one observed around NGC 1275.
``Each simulation, at the maximum resolution of 100 million pixels, takes about 20 days to be completed,'' says Falceta-Gonçalves, who conducted most of the tests and is the first author of the articles.
These studies undoubtedly provide plausible explanations for the mysteries surrounding NGC 1275.
However, how is one to find out the real cause of the homogeneous distribution of the temperature of the gas and of the filaments observed around the galaxy?
One of the means of proving these explanations would be to look, with telescopes, for signs left by stars of very high mass and by supernovas in the more external regions of NGC 1275.
Another strategy, more within the reach of the Brazilian team, would be to conduct new simulations, now combining the precession effect of the active galactic nucleus with the explosion of supernovas on the edges of the galaxy, to find out what happens.
In any event, a little more progress has been made toward understanding the dynamics of galaxy agglomerations such as Perseus and, therefore, of the agglomeration to which the Milky Way belongs.
These building blocks of the Universe, which on a larger scale are organized into super-agglomerations, still hold many secrets.
Luckily, however, astronomers do not give up easily.

Fabrício Marques, from Brasília
The debates at the 4th National Conference on Science, Technology and Innovation (CNCTI), which involved more than 4000 participants in Brasilia from May 26 to 28, reached a series of points of agreement.
A second point of consensus in the talks and discussions was linked to the need for improving mechanisms to stimulate innovation in companies and interaction between researchers and the private sector, both of which have improved in recent years but results are still modest.
``It is imperative that companies devote more to research and development activities, and our economic environment does not favor this change in culture much,'' Davidovich said.
Thirdly, the need to promote the sustainable exploitation of biomes such as the Amazon, the Pantanal and the Cerrado was highlighted, to change the old model that values logging and deforestation for cattle rearing.
According to the Secretary General of the conference, there was still a fourth point of convergence, although still diffuse, involving the importance of stimulating the so-called ``social technologies,'' which consists of using the country's scientific capacity to solve problems of underdevelopment, such as malnutrition and the lack of sanitation, among other things, by working in partnership with the needy.
"There is no single model to be followed, but there is some consensus that social technologies could put the country in a leading position in the type of development that is more sustainable than that in rich countries,'' Davidovich said.
The main conclusions of the conference will be compiled into a document, the Blue Book of Science, Technology and Innovation, which will be published before the presidential elections in October.
The idea is for it to become a reference text for state policies over the next 10 years, thereby signaling to the country's next governors the thinking of the scientific community.
Articles with the proposals made at each of the round tables and plenary sessions of the conference will be written by their respective reporters and published in a revised edition of the journal, Strategic Partnerships, from the Center for Strategic Studies and Management (CGEE), the conference organizer.
Advances made in recent years, such as regularity in funding for research, the vigorous growth of scientific production and the increasing concern of companies about innovation, punctuated discussions at the conference, but some provocative questions helped to make the optimism more realistic: will Brazilian science have the strength needed over the next few years to make the leap that will lead to achieving the level of a developed country?
What is missing for Brazil to win a Nobel Prize in science?
How long will it take to reverse the culture that is still averse to innovation in most Brazilian companies?
Mathematician Jacob Palis, president of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences (ABC), said that one of the major challenges to guarantee this leap will be to triple, by 2020, the number of staff involved in science, ranging from laboratory technicians to PhDs.
``We have to speed up this process without losing quality.
This will demand a huge effort from the scientific and business community.
It will be necessary to increase investments in science to reach a level of about 2% of GDP in 10 years time,'' said Palis, who optimistically said that winning a Nobel Prize is just a matter of time.
``I'm willing to bet that this is going to happen,'' he said.
Physicist Carlos Aragon, president of the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), proposed reviewing concepts that are rooted in the practice of Brazilian universities, such as the early specialization of undergraduate students.
``We must invest in new teaching resources that update the outdated syllabus and motivate students to get involved in research.
We need to give fewer classes and encourage students to use their time for actually studying,'' said Aragon, who also suggested a review of the organization of universities into departments.
``This compartmentalization hinders multidisciplinary research," he said.
The need to invest in academic centers of excellence to avoid bottlenecks was emphasized in some of the presentations, like the one given by Eduardo Krieger, a researcher at the Heart Institute (InCor) and a member of the Board of FAPESP.
FAPESP's scientific director, Carlos Henrique de Brito Cruz, said that since the early 1990s Brazil has been among the four top countries in terms of growth in the number of scientific articles published.
Qualitatively, also, there have been important advances, with articles by Brazilian researchers becoming increasingly more prominent in international journals.
``Brazilian science has experienced a significant rise in both quantity and quality.
One of our challenges in this context is the question of the impact of the science that is produced in Brazil.
The evolution of the number of citations is increasing but is still below the world average,'' he pointed out.
Another challenge, according to Brito Cruz, is to resume the increase in the rate of growth of PhDs .
Until 2003, the number of PhDs grew by 18% a year.
Since then it has been growing at approximately 5% a year.
``The figures show that there is some significant restriction operating in the Brazilian system, which is `putting on the hand brake' in the formation of PhDs.
We need to triple the number of researchers for Brazil to reach levels similar to those in Spain, for example,'' he said.
Brito Cruz has argued for a broader approach when it comes to guiding research in the country.
``We live in a utilitarian time, according to which science needs to help companies innovate, cure disease or combat poverty.
This is important, but it's also important to strengthen the science that makes humanity wiser,'' he said.
Another point emphasized by the scientific director of FAPESP was the need to improve the quality of Brazilian research and he mentioned the Foundation's initiatives, such as the Research, Innovation and Dissemination Centers (Cepids) that receive funding from groups of excellence for a period of 10 years.
``Bold projects may need more time to produce results.
Many of these Cepids are addressing research topics that no longer have a close relationship with their initial objectives.
They can only be bold because they have been lazy for a long time ,'' said Brito Cruz.
Networks - The importance of expanding and giving more quality to post-graduate programs was highlighted several times during the event.
In a session that compiled the recommendations of various regional, preparatory conferences, representatives from the Midwest and Northeast kept coming back to the same theme: it is necessary to create new programs that are capable of preparing more researchers and connecting the already existing programs to those in other regions of the country through networking.
``It would be interesting to make the CNPq's initiatives annual, like the synchronized public bidding notice, which connects consolidated post-graduate programs with others that are still being consolidated,'' said Janesmar Cavalcanti, the Secretary of Science, Technology and Innovation in Alagoas.
Several ways were indicated to boost the innovation capacity of Brazilian companies.
The reports brought by representatives from regional conferences suggested the creation of state and municipal innovation laws, and integration of these efforts with those of the federal government to encourage companies to use their benefits.
The executive manager of the Research and Development Center of Petrobras, Carlos Tadeu Fraga, reported the oil giant's strategy for attracting to Brazil the research and development centers of multinational companies interested in taking advantage of opportunities linked to oil exploration in the pre-salt reserves.
Carlos Américo Pacheco, a professor from The Institute of Economics at the University of Campinas (Unicamp), proposed the creation of sectorial innovation platforms, arguing that the problem requires more accurate monitoring than it is getting at present.
He said that it was impractical to follow only general innovation targets, since information about the meeting of goals takes two years to measure, by which time it is too late to correct their direction.
Glauco Arbix, a professor at the School of Philosophy, Literature and Human Sciences (FFLCH) at the University of São Paulo (USP), argued for the creation of a national innovation agency that has weight, resources and the capacity to sponsor and coordinate interaction between the programs, institutions and policies for science, technology and innovation.
``And this agency should not be linked to the Ministry of Science and Technology, but to the office of the President of the Republic, in order to signal that this is a priority.
Brazil is too large to have small programs.
We need to select our priorities better and establish some form of hierarchy,'' he said.
For Arbix, there is growing maturity in the debate on ST & I in Brazil.
``The way in which business institutions try to deal with technology today has a different perspective from what we were seeing a few years ago.
We must take advantage of this moment to make a leap forward,'' he said.
Living forest - Innovation also plays a crucial role in building a sustainable development project for the Amazon, said Bertha Becker, professor emeritus at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ).
According to Becker the region now has two proposals for sustainable development projects.
``One of these projects, which is associated with climate change, has predominated.
This project defends preservation of living forest, by funding the abandoning of deforestation.
I seriously question this project because it makes the forest unproductive.
It's basically a compensation project for developed countries that will be able to continue being the largest emitters,'' she said.
The other project, according to Bertha, understands sustainable development as a new pattern of development based on science, technology and innovation.
``The challenge in this case is to use natural resources without destroying them, generating jobs and income for millions of inhabitants in the region.
We'll only achieve this with public policies and huge investments in science and innovation,'' she pointed out.
At the same event, Education Minister, Fernando Haddad, suggested to his colleague, Sergio Rezende, head of Science and Technology, that the conclusions of the National Conference on Education, held between March 28 and April 1, be sent to Congress together with the results of CNCTI, thus creating a joint policy for the next 10 years.

Partnership between scientists and journalists in favor of scientific culture are still far apart
Mariluce Moura, from Madrid* and Brasília
Although journalists are originally generalists by definition, there is now increasing evidence that scientific journalists everywhere -- and not only in countries with an Anglo-Saxon tradition -- are investing more and more in the strategy of ongoing improvement in order to perform their jobs with the required rigor, critical spirit and, of course, indispensible level of knowledge of the field that they are writing about.
In this quest, various paths are valid: taking graduate courses that enable one to reflect and investigate with theoretical support and in greater detail one's own practices; or workshops of a more pragmatic nature, which propose, for instance, increasing journalists' competence in the short term in the handling of scientific databases, in order to separate the curds from the whey (i.e., science from pseudoscience) within the vastness of the Web and in the possible and effective possibilities of links between social networks and journalism, among other themes.
One should point out that these consensual recommendations were reached despite all the differences in the experiences of cultural and scientific journalism presented, and even the deep conceptual differences cited.
Thus, if for some journalists the Internet and the democratization of the production of content via the Web are a threat to the very existence of their profession, for others, such as Gumersindo Lafuente, the deputy director of El País, the respected Spanish newspaper, they are a great challenge demanding a near reinvention of the journalist.
``Our narrative has also been tied to reality and today this reality is in the streets and on the Web.
As journalists, we must also report what is going on on the Web,'' he said.
He commented that we are no longer living in times in which one can expect people to go searching for the media, but rather in times in which ``we must take our stories to places where there is talk about the subjects that we deal with on the Internet.''
Furthermore, he bet that, as in a Darwinian environment, ``the quality Internet platforms, whether they are blogs or twitters, will turn into brands, whereas the media that have already turned into brands will only survive if they keep up their quality.''
Speaking of which, Milagros, who on the previous day had sat at a round-table about ``divulging scientific knowledge and the science industries'' (which included a presentation of the Pesquisa Fapesp experience), noted that ``scientific news has a great deal of value when it is well developed, because it generates opinion and knowledge, but it is more risky when it is poorly done and tendentious, because it can give rise to social damage for which all of us will pay.''
According to her, the doors of journalism are increasingly open to pseudoscience, which, particularly when it comes to digital information, requires containment and proof.
In the midst of these discussions, there hung in the air something of the speech by professor José Manuel Sánchez Ron, the head of the History of Science at the Autonomous University of Madrid, who delivered the meeting's opening speech.
``Culture and science are part of intellectual life, but there is mutual misunderstanding, hostility and antipathy between them.''
According to him, the media should not only inform, but also educate when dealing with science -- something with which journalists are unlikely to agree on, strictly speaking.
Silence and noise -- Although on the front of the journalists and the communication courses there is noticeable concern about the quality of scientific journalism, there are indications that within the national system of science and technology the notion of partnering with the media in order to disseminate scientific culture throughout society, an idea that seemed to be flourishing at the beginning of this decade, is now going backwards.
Thus, at the Fourth National Conference on Science, Technology and Innovation, held from May 26 to 28 in Brasília (see article on page 26), which tried to stress as much as possible partnerships in the scientific community, the State, business, and the so-called social sectors, in order to develop a real society of knowledge in the country, the role of the media was ignored, even when what was being discussed was the popularization of science.
Among all the debates held, only 15 minutes were reserved for a speech by a female journalist, Cilene Victor, the chairwoman of the Brazilian Association of Scientific Journalism (ABJC), as part of the ``Building scientific culture'' session.
One should keep in mind that during the Second National Conference, held in 2001, which was organized by professor Cylon Gonçalves during the term of Minister Ronaldo Sardenberg, there were several tables discussing the issue of the public communication of science through journalism.
Thus, in a way, we seem to have resumed the old view of journalism as a mere instrument vis-à-vis science, in which the former is subject to the latter, instead of embracing the more contemporary view of a partnership arrangement for the social dissemination of knowledge.

Possibility of reconciling exploitation and conservation of the forest brings government and entrepreneurs together, but faces resistance
Carlos Fioravanti, from Itaituba*
* The journalist traveled at the invitation of the Brazilian Forestry Service
At the end of the afternoon of May 10, in one of the rooms in the city council building in Itaituba, southwestern Pará, seven senior members of the Brazilian Forestry Service (Serviço Florestal Brasileiro) from the Ministry of the Environment met with eight timber industry entrepreneurs to reconcile their interests in the pursuit of a new system for exploiting the Amazon Region economically: forest concessions, whereby the federal government selects companies that can exploit areas previously defined as public forests for a 40-year period, so as to have the lowest possible environmental impact, contrary to the current approach of the total elimination of the native vegetation.
The conversation was friendly, although the words sounded cautious and the looks expressed mutual mistrust.
Listening to the interested parties or to those who may be affected by the decisions is part of the new approach to using public land.
Based on the Public Forests Stewardship Law, passed in 2006, the Forestry Service selected three companies in 2008 to exploit the 96 thousand hectares of the National Forest of Jamari, in Rondônia, by means of the first public notice of tender concerning the concession of public forests.
The Forestry Service team is currently analyzing the proposals presented as a result of the second public notice, for the exploitation of 140,000 hectares in the National Forest of Saracá-Taquera, in Pará, and is also working on the final version of the third public notice, which concerns the concession of 210,000 hectares, equal to 1.4 times the area of the city of São Paulo, of the National Forest of Amana, in the municipalities of Itaituba and Jacareacanga, in Pará.
``They say it's only a little, but it's just the start,'' stated Antonio Carlos Hummel, director-general of the Forestry Service.
This form of exploitation, called sustainable forest stewardship, might be adopted in 20 million of the 239 million hectares of public forests -- Brazil's total forest areas, 524 million hectares, equals 61% of the country's area.
In July, the exploitation of timber is due to start in the areas covered by the first public notice; additionally, the winners of the second public notice are to be announced and the third public notice, concerning Itaituba, plus a further public notice, also concerning an area in Pará, are to be publicly presented.
As a result of the proposals approved under each public notice, the companies will be able to cut five to six trees per hectare every 30 years, four times less than the loss occurring for natural reasons and far less than happens with deforestation, which suppresses all the vegetation.
The companies will also be allowed to harvest latex, lianas, oils, fruit and seeds and to create tourist activities in the concession areas, according to pre-approved plans.
``We cannot harvest more than the forest can produce,'' states Roberto Waack, president of Amata, one of the three enterprises selected to exploit the tendered areas in Rondônia.
The companies that win the bids will be required to hire at least 80% of their workforce in the locality itself, besides paying the Forestry Service a minimum price per cubic meter of timber, proportional to the commercial value of each species; the ipê (Brazilian walnut), cedro-rosa (Spanish cedar), jatobá (Brazilian cherry) and maçaranduba (bulletwood) are among the most valuable hardwoods.
During the conversation held on the tenth, the lumbermen complained about the minimum price, which they felt was too high.
The next day, alongside representatives of the workers, social movements and local communities, the lumbermen presented these claims with more detailed arguments, at the public hearing that brought together some 250 people in the town's sports gymnasium.
``The concession of public forests is one way out,'' acknowledged Osvaldo Romanholi, president of the union of timber companies in the southeast of Pará, ``but not in the short term.''
The struggle against illegality
One year after the directors and managers of the Forestry Service landed in Itaituba and presented the new approach to timber exploitation, at that time facing far stronger resistance, the forest concessions now seem inevitable, as there is rather less room for companies to act illegally at present than two or three decades ago.
``We want to reduce the illegality of timber exploitation and deforestation,'' argued Hummel.
During the prior meetings and the public hearing, he said that he would do whatever was possible to meet the claims.
``We have legal restraints that do not allow us to do everything we would like to do,'' warned Marcelo Arguelles, the Forestry Service concessions manager, during one of the meetings with the lumbermen.
``We're still going to argue a lot; we too have lawyers,'' forecast one entrepreneur from Jacareacanga, one of Pará's poorest towns, where another public hearing was held three days later.
Sitting in the back seat of a Cessna twin-engine plane, flying over the forest with journalists, Luiz Cesar Cunha Lima, the Forestry Service's public notices coordinator, looked at the areas to be tendered and commented: ``See, it's an excellent area for sustainable forest stewardship.
It is solid forest, with neither rivers nor hills.''
Six hundred meters below, the forest extended all the way to the horizon.
During the public hearing, however, one lumberman recalled that yes, there were hills in the area, and that there are no roads to get to the areas that are to be exploited, which lie some 200 km outside the town - seen from high up, the region's main road, the Trans-Amazonian highway, is a dirt track cutting through the forest.
The possibility of reconciling interests is new in western Pará, which has been well known for its illegal economic activities and land conflicts.
``Up to four years ago, nobody even knew what complying with the law meant,'' says Romanholi, who migrated from the state of Mato Grosso 11 years ago.
Things started changing in 2003, with the resumption of the construction of the BR-163 highway, which runs from Cuiabá, in Mato Grosso, to Santarém, in Pará.
Three years later, the establishment of the BR-163 Sustainable Forestry District started the challenge of exploiting 19 million hectares of native forest without destroying it, across 10 municipalities bordering the highway.
Out of 254 companies previously active in the Sustainable Forestry District, only 39 remained.
``Hummel was called the executioner of lumbermen,'' recalls Romanholi.
``Access to public lands used to be too easy,'' Hummel counterargues.
Little by little, order took over, but resentment persists.
``The government created a reserve on my property,'' accuses Walmir Climaco, mayor of Itaituba.
He had assumed his town council position two weeks earlier (the preceding mayor was impeached for distributing 5,000 food hampers to people not entitled to them), arrived at the public hearing 45 minutes late and did not disguise his mistrust: ``In the past, public opinion wasn't valued much.
The federal government has already been here other times, listened to a lot of people and then done whatever it pleased.''
The mayor himself has felt the effects of the legalization of the exploitation of timber in the region.
Of the 250 employees he previously had to work a 3,000-hectare tract of forest, he now has only three guards.
``Everything has come to a halt, because it was fraudulent,'' he says.
Climaco also owns 5,000 hectares of mining prospecting areas, plus 17 ranches with 100,000 head of cattle.
``Until 1988, deforestation was authorized,'' he recalled, in one of the conversations held during the course of the public hearing.
Aged 49 and born in the state of Ceará, he arrived in Itaituba 23 years ago, ``at the time of minister Mário Andreazza,'' he said, referring to the time of the dictatorship.
``The State is beginning to penetrate the inner areas of the Amazon region, in all senses,'' notes Fernando Ludke, regional director of the Forestry Service.
Established as a municipality in 1856, Itaituba has 130 thousand inhabitants who are, by now, indifferent to its hot, humid climate.
In the late afternoons, young people sit on the benches along the waterfront, open their laptops and connect to the public web access network.
Meanwhile, untreated sewage flows into the Tapajós River.
In the evenings, it is easy to spot rats and dogs rummaging in the litter that is scattered through the streets.
A lot of gold has flowed through this area -- far more than the current 100 kg a month, according to José Antunes, president of the Tapajós Gold Mining Association, or 300 kg, according to the mayor.
In one corner of the Itaituba airport, a drawing made from a photo depicts the golden age: a plane that upon landing partially hid another, during a time of heavy traffic in the place that has a reputation for having been the busiest airport for small planes in Brazil.
``There was lots of gold, lots of women, lots of cachaça [sugarcane spirits].
Today it's civilized.
It's no longer fun,'' says a former goldwasher who observes the hearing at a distance and who, instead of saying his name, grins roguishly, like someone who is recalling the good old times.
Afterwards, now with an earnest expression, he adds: ``This region is a chronic wound in the jungle.''
One or two inhabitants also tell us that there are still a few of the formerly frequent gunmen around, who used to kill for gold, land or women.
The number of jobs to actually be created and the profitability of the forest are subject to adjustment, as the trees start to be taken from the woods to the sawmills.
Only time will tell whether one of the inhabitants' fears -- that powerful multinationals may win the tenders and muscle the local firms out -- will come true or not and whether the forest concessions will really work as a strategy for imposing territorial order in the Amazon Region.
At least the transparency of the tenders, with each step explained on the Internet, is impressive.
Likewise, the risks to forest integrity seem minimal, according to studies initiated some 60 years ago in the Amazon Region.
In an experiment conducted in the National Forest of Tapajós, in Santarém, state of Pará, stock was taken of trees with a diameter greater than 45 cm in a total area of 64 hectares in 1975; then in 1979, some were felled, at a volume per hectare that was double what is currently allowed.
The same forest segment was reassessed in 2009 -- so, 30 years later, the same time between harvests has been established by the current legislation.
``The forest showed recovery capabilities to the point of making another harvest possible, within the limits of the current concentration of tree felling,'' says José Natalino Macedo Silva, director of the Forestry Service.
Long-term contract
``After the removal of the trees, the diversity of species diminishes momentarily, but subsequently it recovers,'' he says.
According to him, after 30 years, wood extraction in the National Forest of Tapajós has increased the diversity of species rather than diminishing it, as many biologists had feared, because it has generated light and space for other species to germinate and grow.
``New species move in and out constantly, because the forest is a dynamic environment, subject to disturbances of several kinds and strengths, such as hurricanes, landslides or clearings that come into being when trees die and keel over,'' comments Natalino.
``Through forest stewardship, man can control the intensity of the interventions, so as to minimize them and enable sustainable harvesting indefinitely.''
According to him, the concession contracts limit the impact of the construction of infrastructure (roads, lumberyards and the so-called dragging trails) to 8% of the forest's area.
``The current legislation is cautious regarding the environmental impact of stewardship because it requires the forestry companies to leave at least three trees of each species standing in every 100 hectares and 10% of the trees of cutting size, to ensure the continuity of the species.''
The current rules for exploiting native forests mean dividing the area to be exploited into 30 parts.
Every year, the firm can only use one thirtieth of the area and the company must maintain a reservation of 5% of each forest type in each area.
``Today, Ibama has 140 inspectors of good stewardship practices,'' says Natalino.
The work plan, to be approved by the federal government, is based on an inventory with botanical identification -- authenticated by an official herbarium -- of the trees in each of the areas that are to be exploited.
At the Amata headquarters in São Paulo, on the seventeenth floor of a building near the Pinheiros River, Roberto Waack told us that his team identified the species, height and diameter of some 27 thousand trees in the first lot that should start being exploited as soon as Ibama approves his plan for which trees to fell.
According to him, even with all this prior work, the operation pays off in financial terms, because the cost of exploiting a forest that is already formed is far lower than that of a eucalyptus or pine forest that has to be planted and only produces timber after at least seven years.
Furthermore, as room for wood of illegal origin is shrinking, ``the demand for wood of certified origin has been exceeding supply,'' says Waack.
His plan is to produce so-called dry planed wood -- timber treated to be used for flooring and for door and window frames -- this year, at a sawmill that he is setting up in Rondônia.
In 2011, he wants to start using the waste from the exploitation of timber to produce blocks that are reminiscent of dog food and that can be used as fuel in ovens.
``Stewardship must go hand-in-hand with adding value to forest products,'' says Waack.
``We aren't going into the forest with the idea of extracting everything fast and then leaving.
We are protected by a 40-year agreement.''
The long-term view makes a difference.
One of the partners in Amata is the designer Etel Carmona, who began working 20 years ago with tropical woods and who now sells, in Brazil and in Europe, furniture and objects such as an exclusive wooden vase for a sum equal to almost R$5 thousand.

The Brazilian and foreign experts that met in May in São Paulo concluded that production of biofuels, in particular of ethanol, could increase without competing for land for the production of food and with less environmental impact, if more scientific and technological research is conducted and if there is more interaction with public policies for social and economic development.
``Those who design public policies become confused in the face of all the uncertainties about the viability of a sustainable future,'' commented Lee Lyndt, a researcher from Dartmouth College in the United States, in one of the presentations at the ``Scientific Issues on Ethanol'' workshop, held on May 24 and 26 at FAPESP headquarters.
He and other speakers highlighted the adverse environmental impact of the world's current energy production model, which is based on non-renewable fuels, mainly oil, coal and natural gas.
``Our comfort depends on fossil fuels,'' stated José Goldemberg, from the University of São Paulo.
However, according to him, this energy model not only risks exhaustion, as oil reserves become depleted, but is also socially unfair, as Europe's inhabitants consume an amount of oil equal to six tons a year, whereas Africans consume 10 times less.
``The use of modern renewable sources, which is the environmentalists' dream, is growing, but there is still a long way to go before they become more widespread.
The future definitely belongs to renewable energy, but only in 20 or 30 years time.''
Goldemberg was one of the authors of the report ``Lighting the way: toward a sustainable energy future,'' requested two years ago by the InterAcademy Council from 15 academies of science.
Recently published by FAPESP (under the title Um futuro com energia sustentável: iluminando o caminho, 300 pages), this document stresses the role of governments in supporting long-term investments in energy infrastructure and research to help disseminate renewable energy sources, including biofuels.
``The expansion of biofuel production in Brazil and in the United States has raised serious controversy on the incompatibility of food and fuel,'' recalled Goldemberg.
Over the course of two days of debates, promoted by FAPESP, by the Brazilian Academy of Science (ABC) and by the InterAcademy Panel (IAP), this conflict was cleared and land limitations stopped being seen as an obstacle to the expansion of ethanol production.
Hypothetically, doubling Brazil's livestock productivity from one to two steers per hectare could add 100 million hectares to the current 4 million hectares of sugarcane, thereby supplying two thirds of the global demand for ethanol.
Changes in sight -- Furthermore, 1 billion acres could be converted to agriculture worldwide.
``Brazil only uses one percent of the area that could be used for agriculture,'' states Carlos Henrique de Brito Cruz, FAPESP's scientific director.
Several speakers commented that the improved use of land could expand ethanol production while also meeting the rising demand for food and reducing world poverty.
Patricia Osseweijer, a researcher from the Delft University of Technology, in the Netherlands, told those at the meeting that the current portfolio of energy sources in Europe is neither environmentally safe nor sustainable.
According to her, even if European countries used 40 million hectares to produce biofuels, only one third of the demand would be met.
``Finding lasting, biodegradable, environment-friendly and economically viable solutions is very hard,'' she acknowledged.
``We must expand public involvement and improve the quality of communication.
The debates still lack clarity and only reflect one side.''
Horward Alper, from the University of Ottawa, Canada, reiterated: ``Clear and concise communication is absolutely crucial.
You must be understood by your 16-year old daughter.''
Substantial changes in other habits seem to be indispensible in the pursuit of a less polluted planet.
As the transport sector currently consumes one third of the energy produced in the world, Cylon Gonçalves, professor emeritus at the State University of Campinas (Unicamp) and FAPESP's deputy coordinator, commented: ``Only a radical transformation of the means of transport and of mankind's needs will lead us to sustainability.
There are scientific and technical limits to an ongoing growth in demand.''
Some changes could take place immediately.
``If developing countries such as China and India continued using coal, but with American or Japanese technology, they would gain energy efficiency and the emissions of greenhouse gases would drop by one third,'' suggested Goldemberg.

Since February of 2010, some of the agents at a healthcare center on the outskirts of the city of São Paulo have been going into the field to collect data on the local population carrying a powerful ally in their pocket: a smart mobile phone, linked to the Web via the 3G data network, with a little keyboard for writing, GPS and activation by using a touch-sensitive screen.
With this little device in hand, the family health teams of the Paulo VI Basic Healthcare Unit (UBS) in the vicinity of the Raposo Tavares highway, on the outskirts of São Paulo city's western region, can set aside their pen and paper and record straight into the smartphone all the data pertaining to each home visited and its inhabitants.
If the street where the person lives has no formal name, which is not unheard of, there is no problem.
The device's GPS always records the geographic coordinates of the records that the healthcare agents create for each individual.
Once the visit has been completed, the UBS team saves the form and transmits it directly to the project's database from the person's home, with the aid of the little phone.
In just a few seconds, the medical profile of a Paulo VI family is in a FMUSP computer.
Using smartphones to feed the embryo of a future set of medical records online is part of a series of initiatives designed to reorganize and humanize the care provided by the Single Healthcare System (SUS) in an area in the West of the São Paulo state capital, in the micro-region that comprises the districts of Butantã and Jaguaré, where some 420 thousand people live.
This is the chief aim of the West Region Project, which also engages in scientific research and teaches medicine.
In October 2008, FMUSP signed a management agreement with São Paulo city's Municipal Health Bureau and, through this project, took over the management of the primary structure at the healthcare centers, walk-in clinics and emergency rooms in these two districts (see article in Pesquisa Fapesp issue 164).
In this part of the city, which is turning into a laboratory for new SUS practices, the implementation of the project is being conducted gradually.
For the time being, five of the region's 14 UBSs are already under the management of the project team.
At the Paulo VI unit, the FMUSP researchers decided to tackle one of the public healthcare system's weaknesses: the poor quality of medical information about the patients who resort to SUS.
``An efficient database will allow the integrated system to work better,'' states Sandra Grisi, president of the steering council at the West Region Project.
``Like the patient, information must also run through the system.''
According to Alexandra Brentani, the project's executive director, the lack of data on the population that lives in the area covered by a UBS or by a healthcare center in the city of São Paulo is currently substantial.
When there are family healthcare teams that regularly visit the homes in the region, all the information collected is written down on a paper form.
The problem is that sometimes this information is lost along the way, neither being digitized nor going into computer systems.
``Even when the data are entered into Siab [the Basic Care Information System of the Ministry of Health] they are not permanent,'' comments the FMUSP manager, an expert in healthcare resources management.
``After one month they are deleted.''
To solve this problem, the West Region team looked for an alternative way for the community agents themselves to feed the medical information database directly from the field, with no intermediaries.
Giving them a laptop was one possibility, but the risk of theft in the streets was high.
This left smartphones, which are more discreet, but can handle the job.
``People already know how to use mobile phones and with just a minimum of training they manage to fill out the electronic form,'' says Marco Antonio Gutierrez, the project's IT coordinator.
Automatic saving -- The next step was to determine what kind of device would be most appropriate for testing with the work of the family healthcare teams.
The researchers chose mobile phones that run on Google's Android operating system and created a data collection software program, GeoHealth, which runs on the said platform.
Access to the programming that makes Android run is totally open and free of charge, making application developers' work easier.
This allows GeoHealth to be easily integrated into the mobile phone and enables it to be user-friendly.
Except for the person's name, GeoHealth requires very little keying in of data.
Writing on a smartphone's tiny keypad is uncomfortable.
Therefore, the West Region team created a form which can be completed by the user simply touching the device's screen.
Practically all the information about the home and its inhabitants' health history can be entered into this form.
In the tests carried out at UBS Paulo VI, the healthcare agents are using five devices (three provided by Motorola and two provided by LG, both of them firms that established a partnering agreement with the project) and they are transmitting the data via TIM's 3G network, which is also supporting the initiative.
``If there is no network signal in the area where the agent is, GeoHealth automatically saves all the data in the smartphone's memory,'' says João Henrique Gonçalves de Sá, a systems analyst working on the West Region project.
``As soon as the device finds the signal, the form is automatically transmitted to our database.''
With the help of the mobile phones, which are blocked in terms of regular phone calls, the records of some 150 families that live in the area covered by UBS Paulo VI, totaling about 700 people, have been entered into the system created by FMUSP.
As all the data are geo-referenced, one can see on the Google maps system the health status of the inhabitants in any given home, as well as the more general medical status of all the homes in the region.
These tools should be immensely valuable for epidemiological studies in the future, especially once the project's database acquires more data and includes information about the inhabitants served by the other UBSs in Butantã and Jaguaré.
When anybody wants to know where the cases of pregnant women with dengue fever can be found in a district, for instance, they will be able to research this in the database to find an answer.
``We also took care to design a system that can be totally integrated with the Ministry of Health database, including the medical records form that Siab uses,'' comments Alexandra.
Even though smartphones are not a cheap item to add to the equipment that SUS supplies to its agents, the FMUSP researchers believe that in the long run they will pay for themselves, becoming the basis of a more efficient medical data collection system.

Out of control
Inflammation unleashed by sepsis damages the heart
Salvador Nogueira
Defending the organism from itself when it launches a desperate attack against its own cells is the main challenge facing doctors in cases of sepsis, a generalized infection caused by bacteria or a virus, accompanied by aggressive inflammation that attacks the organs it should protect.
Assessing the health of patients with sepsis, a problem that every year affects 18 million people worldwide, doctors in Brazil and from other countries have observed that the risk of dying increases a lot when the most damaged organ is the heart: the death rate reaches 80% if the heart muscle is affected and starts pumping oxygen-rich blood less efficiently to the rest of the body, compared to 20% when there is no heart damage.
Now researchers at the University of São Paulo (USP) in Ribeirão Preto have gone a step further.
Analyzing the hearts of people and animals that died from sepsis, the team, coordinated by pathologist Marcos Rossi and by pharmacologist Fernando Cunha, has characterized the type of damage that causes sepsis-related inflammation in cardiac cells.
More importantly, it also found a promising way to protect the heart and thus gain time for the body to regain control of the situation.
The main advance of the group from Ribeirão Preto was to see what happens with the heart cells on a molecular scale.
In studies with laboratory animals the researchers discovered that molecules of nitric oxide released in the inflammation damaged cell walls making them more permeable to calcium.
The consequence of this alteration is an overdose of this particular chemical element that leads to cell death --if the number of cells affected is very large, it reduces the capacity of the heart to pump blood.
Published in March 2010 in scientific journal, Shock, this finding is significant because it suggests ways of slowing down the process of wear and tear in the heart.
There are drugs on the market that block the absorption of calcium and that are used to control blood pressure and to regulate the heartbeat.
Currently, Cunha and Rossi's group, in partnership with researchers from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, are evaluating if these drugs really help keep the heart functioning when administered during sepsis.
The study is still ongoing, but preliminary results are fairly expressive.
In one of the experiments the researchers administered compounds that prevent the absorption of calcium -- the so-called calcium channel blockers -- to mice that had suffered a perforation of the intestines and had developed a generalized infection.
Then, they compared what happened with a group of animals with untreated sepsis and with a group of healthy rodents.
The calcium channel blockers provided some degree of survival to the sick mice.
Without the medication most of the animals with sepsis died in less than 24 hours.
When treated, however, all survived the first day.
``The death rate of animals with sepsis that received the calcium blocker was similar to that of mice in the control group that had no infection,'' explains Rossi.
``We're enthusiastic about the results.''
Many more tests are still needed - and possibly years of work - to prove whether this strategy is efficient and can be adopted safely on a daily basis in hospitals.
However, one fact makes the researchers optimistic: it will be simpler to carry out tests on humans, since calcium channel blockers are already used to treat heart problems.
Rossi remembers, however, that it is premature to suppose that everything is going to work out all right, because the circumstances to which the animals were subjected are quite different from those involving patients in hospitals.
As a pathologist, Rossi performed many autopsies on patients who had died from sepsis and found that almost always their hearts had undergone radical changes.
``The heart of a patient with sepsis was different, somewhat flaccid, indicating that during its life it had had functioning problems,'' he says.
Analysis of material obtained from autopsies in fact indicated morphological changes in the cardiac muscle.
Presented in Shock in 2007, these changes were like a picture of the final moment.
In order to know how sepsis-associated heart damage begins and evolves the researchers had to resort to an experimental model of the problem -- they chose to work with mice, because the organism of these rodents functions in a similar way to that of humans.
By means of an incision in the animal's intestine bacteria from the digestive tract reach the thoracic cavity and cause a generalized infection.
Right from the start the researchers noted an important change in the structure of the heart of the animals that developed sepsis: there was a significant reduction in the number of proteins responsible for keeping the heart cells strongly united.
As a result, these cells, known as cardiomyocytes, separated from each other, Rossi observed when analyzing the tissue under an electronic microscope.
It was as if, at the cell level, the heart muscle had been `dismantled'.
Even if this transformation, which was described in 2007 in Critical Care Medicine, were to occur at the microscopic level, the `dismantling' produced easily observable consequences.
For the heart to beat regularly, its cells need to be firmly attached to one another in such a way that they contract or relax in harmony.
With the cells disconnected the heart rhythm became irregular and the heart quickly stopped.
The problem was outside, in the so-called extracellular environment.
The group noted that a protein structure, the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC), which serves as support and shapes the cells, seemed to dissolve in the hearts of animal victims of sepsis, the researchers from Ribeirão Preto revealed in an article published in Laboratory Investigation in April this year.
If this heart damage is indeed caused by the inflammation associated with sepsis, the solution for increasing the survival rate of those who develop the most serious forms might be in controlling the inflammation and the damage caused by it.
According to the researchers from Ribeirão Preto, this would be an important transformation in the way of dealing with the problem, since attempts are generally only made to fight the infectious agents with antibiotics and antiviral drugs.
``The changes identified are therapeutic targets, whose modulation may reduce morbidity and mortality in sepsis,'' says Rossi.
They are not the only ones who think so.
At the University of Utah, in the United States, the group led by cardiologist Dean Li, of which Brazilian physician, Fernando Augusto Bozza, from the Evandro Chagas Institute of Clinical Research, in Rio de Janeiro forms part, tried to control inflammatory reactions resulting from sepsis or bird flu in an unusual way.
Researchers gave the mice a compound that prevented the chemical communicators that feed the inflammation from leaving the bloodstream and reaching the tissue.
In this way they managed to reduce the level of damage to the organism of the rodents, according to an article published in Science Translational Medicine on March 17.
``By blocking the harmful effects of the inflammation in the host and stabilizing the blood vessels, we identified a totally different strategy for treating these infections,'' said Li.
``In essence, we show that instead of attacking the pathogen, we can target the host to help it fight the infection.''
Adequate control of sepsis, however, should demand more of an action strategy.
In a recent study made in partnership with researchers from the University of Glasgow, in Scotland, pharmacologist José Carlos Alves Filho, from Cunha's team, gave mice with sepsis a protein, which is naturally produced by cells in the defense system, which acts as a chemical communicator of anti-inflammatory action: interleukin 33 or IL-33.
Besides reducing inflammation in the organism without eliminating it in the original center of infection, this protein stimulated the migration of a specific type of defense cell - neutrophils - which eliminate bacteria efficiently.
The results of this experimental therapy were clear.
Only 20% of the rodents treated with IL-33 died of sepsis, while the mortality rate in the group that received an innocuous compound was 80%.
In the article in which they presented these data in Nature Medicine on May 16, the researchers suggest that the effect the IL-33 produced in mice is likely to be also observed in humans, since neutrophils are less active in people who develop more serious cases of sepsis.
Less than a month before, another member of Cunha and de Rossi's team, pharmacologist Fernando Spiller, had shown that the use of hydrogen sulfide, or hydrosulfuric acid (H2S), the gas responsible for the stench of rotten eggs, induces a migration of neutrophils and another defense cell group, the leucytes, to the initial infection area (see Pesquisa Fapesp No. 146).
This cellular reinforcement eliminated the bacteria and reduced the mortality rate among the mice receiving the compound to 13%, compared to nearly 80% among those not treated, according to an article published in American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine.
Despite being encouraging these advances only represent the initial step on a long journey towards improving the control of sepsis, a public health problem that is especially serious in developing countries, where resources are scarcer.
A survey done years ago by the Latin American Institute for Sepsis Studies showed that of the R$ 41 billion spent in 2003 on intensive therapy by the Brazilian health system, more than R$ 17 billion was used to treat 400,000 patients with sepsis, of which 227,000 died.

The botanist who wrote books at Court
Books were written 210 years ago by Brother Mariano Veloso about the problems of Brazil as a colony
Neldson Marcolin
For three years, between 1799 and 1801, a Brazilian editor in Lisbon gathered around himself in a print shop a group of illustrious Brazilians and Portuguese who were keen to produce technical European texts.
Most of them dealt with issues relating to agriculture and production methods that were more efficient than those used by farmers and animal breeders in Portugal and Brazil.
Brother Veloso's fame, however, comes from before this.
His baptismal name was José Veloso Xavier and he was born in the former São José d'El Rei, today Tiradentes (MG).
Little is known about the background of this religious man.
It is known that at 19 he entered the monastery of São Boaventura in Macacu and after five years went to the Santo Antonio monastery in Rio.
He became a geometry and natural history teacher, but his main interest was always botany.
In 1783, the monk was officially linked to the Portuguese government as one of those in charge of carrying out philosophical voyages of recognition of the Colony, as they were known at the time, and collecting specimens of fauna and flora that were sent to the Court.
Admiration for Veloso had the Viceroy, Luis de Vasconcelos e Sousa - who had a special appreciation for the natural sciences - to determine that he travel throughout the whole of the province of Rio to collect and examine local plants.
For eight years (1783-1790), Veloso collected thousands of specimens that would shape his major work, Flora fluminense.
Several companions from the congregation helped him describe the plants and draw what he had collected.
Flora fluminense contained 1626 species distributed across 396 genera.
Its publication in 10 volumes was an event of epic dimensions that was only fully completed in 1881, 70 years after the death of Veloso.
Because of Veloso's largely self-taught formation, he did not have a comfortable relationship with the Royal Academy of Sciences of Portugal.
The Portuguese naturalist community never recognized him as one of their own, according to historians Maria de Fatima Nunes and João Carlos Brigola, from the University of Evora, in Portugal, in a biographical essay that forms part of the book A Casa Literária do Arco do Cego (National Press / Mint / National Library, Lisbon, 1999).
Veloso went to Lisbon in 1790 and six years later published the agrarian periodical, Paladio Portuguez and Clarim de Palas, which dealt with news and improvements in agriculture, manufacturing and trade.
In 1799, he was appointed to the Arco do Cego and even after the print shop was taken over by Regia in 1801, he continued working in the area.
``Veloso published books that were always concerned with problems of the Colony,'' says historian Marcia Ferraz, from the Simão Mathias Center for the Study of the History of Science, the Pontifical Catholic University of São Paulo (PUC-SP).
O fazendeiro do Brasil [The Farmer from Brazil] series, for example, ran to 11 volumes that dealt with everything from the manufacture of sugar to the growing of coffee, cocoa and dye plants and taught how to prepare dairy products.''
In the Arco do Cego's 3 years 83 books were written or translated, many of them published in partnership with other printers.
The topics covered agriculture, natural history, medicine and public health, marine, the exact sciences, poetry and history.
The prints and technical drawings were abundant and had a clear didactic purpose.
With the French invasion in 1808, Veloso returned to Rio where he died in 1811 aged 69.
His work as editor and botanist was well recognized.
He did not live to see his greatest work published.

Fabrício Marques
For the pioneer in renal physiology research in Brazil, Gerhard Malnic, 76, one of the pleasures of science was always the possibility of using his own hands, whether it was to manipulate and dose the fluid extracted from the minute tubules of the kidneys of animals in the laboratory and of human beings, or to invent equipment - micropipettes and electrode carriers, hand-crafted for techniques that he himself developed and that are today cited in reference books.
``Today it's rarer, but in my time it was something fantastic,'' says the researcher, in his calm voice and slight German accent.
Head Professor in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics at the Institute of Biomedical Sciences (ICB), at the University of São Paulo (USP), Malnic was born in Milan, the son of Austrians, and moved to Brazil when he was 4 years old; he took Brazilian nationality when he was 23.
Based in Sao Paulo, where his father, a chemist, worked as a representative of a German dye company and later for the Matarazzo empire, Malnic studied at the Visconde de Porto Seguro school.
He became interested in physiology in the second year of college and, under the influence of Professor Alberto Carvalho da Silva, he specialized in renal physiology, an area at that time little explored in Brazil.
He did post-doctoral studies at Tulane University, in New Orleans, between 1961 and 1962 and at Cornell University Medical College, New York, between 1962 and 1964, in the laboratory of Gerhard Giebisch, with whom he is still collaborating today.
Back at USP, he set up the laboratory of micropuncture and renal microperfusion, a method of collecting fluid from renal tubules (where water, minerals and vitamins are returned to the blood, leaving the urine) using micropipettes, he studied the transport mechanisms of potassium in the kidney, as well as the role of sodium, hormonal factors, changes in the acid-base balance and nephrotoxic drugs in the reabsorption of bicarbonate.
He has written and published more than 120 papers in international journals, as well as a book on renal physiology.
He has already tutored eight Masters and two dozen PhDs and has become one of the main points of reference in his field in Brazil.
In parallel with his laboratory work, he has presided over scientific bodies, like the Brazilian Society of Biophysics (1983-1985), Brazilian Society of Physiology (1985-1988), the Federation of Societies for Experimental Biology (FESBE) and the Institute for Advanced Studies (IEA ) at USP.
Now retired, he has witnessed the departure from the scene of some of his disciples, but he continues working actively in his laboratory at the ICB.
So that's why I think that they'll not kick me out, despite my age,'' he says, jokingly.
"Right now I only have one PhD student, but I'm trying to get some more.
Young people prefer to stick with the youngest ones, too,'' he says.
Married to teacher and translator, Margot Petry Malnic, the father of two daughters, biochemist Betina and singer and song-arranger, Beatriz, and the grandfather of three girls, Gerhard Malnic gave Pesquisa Fapesp the following interview:
You were born in Italy but you're Austrian.
How did you end up in Brazil?
I was born in Italy, but by accident.
My father was born in 1901 in Austria, in what is now Croatia.
At home, we spoke German.
My father's family was Slovenian and my mother was Austrian, so I'm descended more from German than Slovenians.
My father studied chemistry, graduated around 1925, at a very difficult time for Austria, which was practically finished after the First World War.
He worked in several countries after the war, including Germany, Poland and Italy, where my sister and I were born.
However, I came here when I was four.
Why did your family come to Brazil?
My father was a chemist, a dye-maker.
He worked in Italy, in the textile industry.
In Germany, dyes were chemically based.
He was hired by a German chemical company to come to Brazil.
One of the reasons was that he had had experience in Latin countries.
So, he came to Brazil as a representative of this firm locally.
We went first to Rio and he soon saw that what was really interesting in terms of industry was São Paulo.
We moved here and I went to the Visconde de Porto Seguro School when I was six or seven.
Which was a school for the German community...
It has been for the German community since the 19th century.
This school was nationalized, you might say, because of the war.
I learned German there, too.
At home, I learned a little Latin and Greek, because my father thought it was important.
He had learned this at the Gymnasium, in Vienna, so he thought that I had to learn a little.
However, the fact is that, when he arrived here he worked for some time at this firm, which soon after was confiscated by the government when Brazil entered the Second World War.
That's when he started working for Matarazzo, in the Belenzinho district, in a textile plant.
At Visconde de Porto Seguro, I was a good student.
The war didn't affect me.
My father was a person who had resources.
He soon got back on his feet and then he bought a farm in the north of Paraná and worked for other chemical companies.
I always liked chemistry because my father was a chemist; he even set up a small laboratory at home.
However, his suggestion to me was as follows: ``Look, here in Brazil the best university is that of medicine; it's best for you to study medicine.''
I followed his advice.
What was the Medical School at USP like when you studied there?
That was from 1952.
It wasn' t very different from today.
I came first in the entrance exams.
I started studying physiology in the 2nd year of medicine.
My professor was Alberto Carvalho da Silva, who would become the director of FAPESP.
He was a fantastic person, who set up a good laboratory.
He worked with vitamins, but I thought that I shouldn't work with them because there was already someone doing this.
Something he wanted to do was to work with the renal part of vitamins, as they were eliminated.
We sat down together at the laboratory bench to read a book by American physiologist, Homer Smith; that was in 1954.
I started studying the renal excretion of vitamin B1, or thiamin, in dogs.
What was new was both studying the renal excretion of vitamins, as well as working with dogs that were not anesthetized.
Because there was an idea that anesthetized animals, principally in the case of vitamins, could suffer changes in functioning, we worked with a dog that was not anesthetized.
We were careful not to cause pain...It was a bit complicated, because we had to introduce a catheter, facilitate the collection of the urine, take blood samples and, what's more, the vitamin doses were very complicated.
This work led to my first paper, with Dr. Alberto, in the American Journal of Physiology, one of the most prestigious physiology journals.
Were there groups working on this in Brazil?
There were people in the clinical area; Dr. José de Barros Magaldi, for example.
There was also the group at the Escola Paulista de Medicina [Paulista Medical School], also in the clinical part.
However, in physiology there were some people who worked as clinicians and had a laboratory, like Marcelo Marcondes, who is retired now, and Antonino Rocha, who came a bit later; he was a student of Marcondes and we worked together later.
Antonino Rocha was killed by someone trying to steal his car; those kind of things happened at that time.
The fact that you chose renal physiology was influenced by Professor Alberto, is that right?
We went together to an international physiology congress in Buenos Aires and we talked to Professor Robert Franklin Pitts, who was one of the greatest renal physiologists of the time.
He said: ``I have two young people who are beginning to work with me and they speak German and are just beginning in a new area of physiology,'' which was micropunction.
In that book by Homer Smith he described all the first part of micropunction, how to puncture renal tubules and obtain samples.
It's a technique that began at the end of the 1920s and the beginning of the 1930s.
They used this technique to get details of the functioning of the renal tubules and also the renal glomerules [functional units of the kidneys that filter the blood].
Professor Pitts said: ``Come to my laboratory, which is in New York, at the Cornell University Medical College.''
So I got a scholarship from the Rockefeller Foundation.
At the time, FAPESP didn't exist, but the Rockefeller Foundation helped Brazil a lot.
It had helped Dr. Alberto himself.
He went to New York, but first I had to do a year of basic studies, because there were no post-graduate studies here.
I was always a person who accepted good suggestions.
I thought the idea was interesting.
I spent a year at Tulane University, in New Orleans, studying English, mathematics and biochemistry and I did some physiology courses; I learned a lot from them.
My English was good; at home, I had had private lessons.
I even knew a lot more math than other people did.
So I did a physics-chemistry course, which the others didn't do, which for me was excellent, because from early on I'd been interested in the mechanisms of ionic transport, for which mathematics was important.
So, I managed to complete this course, which helped me a lot on the rest of the internship.
When was this?
This was in 1961, 1962.
There were several Brazilians and other people from Latin America on this course.
It was a Rockefeller foundation program for encouraging Latin American science.
I stayed a year in New Orleans, and from there I went to Robert Franklin Pitts' laboratory and met two young researchers, who were coincidentally Austrian.
They didn't know I was of Austrian descent: ``He's Brazilian; let's see how he works.''
Who were they?
He worked for some time with a researcher called Phillis Bott, who had worked with A. N.
Richards, the pioneer who had developed micropunction.
She was working at the Women's Medical College of Philadelphia, a medical school for women; at the time that kind of thing existed -- a school just for women.
At the time, it wasn't so complicated in terms of equipment, but I got a microscope from the School of Medicine, which Dr Alberto managed to get hold of for me, and a series of other things -- micromanipulators and a chlorate doser from Phillis Bott.
Nowadays, when you arrive in a laboratory like this in the United States there are 10 or 15 other post-doctoral researchers and you see your boss from a distance.
At that time, there was Giebisch, a technician, and myself so we really did work together, which was very positive when starting out on something new.
We developed a method for microdosing sodium and potassium and then we studied potassium excretion mechanisms.
We managed to observe how potassium excretion occurred in various tubular segments, in the renal tubules.
Formerly, you only got a comparison between blood and urine and we could puncture the various tubules, the proximal tubule, the distal tubule, separately.
We managed to discover how potassium was excreted.
What we did at the time was something pioneering; all the physiology books carry this, even today.
What was your return to Brazil like?
I came back to set up a laboratory.
Despite the initial difficulties, I managed to do quite a lot of things.
The first thing was to study the way of handling chlorate, which I only did because I had suitable apparatus.
As I didn't really know what I was going to do, I decided: ``Well, let's do something that I can do with what I've got: I'm going to do micropunction and something with chlorate.''
I drew off a sample of tubular fluid and made a fairly complicated dosage.
Few people did it, because it was too difficult to do.
However, I was stubborn.
And as a result I managed to push the work forward at the Medical School; I managed to have published an article on the effect of the diuretic furosemide in the transport of chlorates in Nature.
I had gotten hold of the material and I invented the project.
Afterwards, I constructed this sodium and potassium microdosing equipment here, which was possible because the physiology people had a type of mechanical laboratory; there were people there capable of building things.
See this apparatus [shows an old piece of equipment on display in his laboratory].
It has a small flame in the middle and in this small flame, we put a platinum loop; on top of the platinum loop we placed a drop of water and in the water was the solution taken from the renal tubule.
To do that here I had help from my first doctoral student, Professor Francisco Lacaz Vieira.
He made the equipment for me; he helped build the electronic part, which were two valves, one on each side, one for potassium and the other for sodium, and it had to have 2000 volts - high voltage, at that time.
We did that and it worked.
I was lucky to have Francisco Lacaz, who retired two years ago.
His uncle, Joaquim Lacaz de Moraes had set up a wonderful laboratory.
He was a neurophysiologist, but he was also one of those people who built things, electrical things; the whole Lacaz family was very good at electronics.
So he set up a laboratory on top of the current school library.
In this laboratory, we had a huge space that was not all used.
Then he began working with me, which was great because he helped me a lot.
He's a person of great ability, very intelligent; he was the head professor here for a long time.
I suggested that he measure the pH in renal tubules, and to do this he managed to make an antimony microelectrode.
We produced some very interesting things.
Was it necessary to make your own equipment.
Yes, if you wanted to produce anything.
And we then produced the work of the mechanisms of hydrogen secretion and the production of acid by the kidneys.
It had over 300 citations.
It was a study of the secretion of the hydrogen ion in renal tubules.
It was something that was being done - others were doing it but were not using this same method, this same microelectrode.
Solomon.
Was there a mismatch between what you could do there and here?
There was, but at the time, we managed to do a lot in the lab.
For a long time we had a good machine shop in the department.
Unfortunately, our mechanic died a few years ago and he was not replaced, because nowadays physiology has changed; it's no longer the type of hands-on physiology it used to be.
It's more the physiology of molecular biology, which has equipment that's always used, like the spectrophotometer, centrifuges, things like that which you buy but don't make.
I really liked using my hands, which was fundamental for renal micropuncture, because we produced gate electrodes and micropipettes; we had to.
You spent the whole day building something or another.
Today, it's not at all common.
What other work would you highlight?
There's our work with potassium and sodium.
Professor Giebisch, in the United States, contributed a lot, but I collaborated with him -- even today we collaborate; we did a lot together, especially with sodium and potassium.
Here, in addition to sodium and potassium, I also worked with hydrogen.
We studied the acidification of renal tubules.
This was also first done with microelectrodes, which are micro-instruments made in a micro-forge, where we produce a tip filled with antimony - antimony is a metal sensitive to pH.
Then we moved from antimony to an ion exchange resin, which is a kind of slightly oily solution that we put into the electrode that contains a substance that is also sensitive to pH.
At the end of last year, I was at Yale University in New Haven with a student of mine, Lucilia Lessa from Fortaleza, and Giebisch always said, "You're the only one in the world who knows how to do this technique, microperfusion, dosing potassium with microelectrodes.
I've done some 130 pieces of work on this, more or less.
That's not much for the United States, but for us here ..And it's good, because our methods are very complicated, difficult to do and as a result, they take a long time.
How many researchers have you turned out?
I've been responsible for tutoring 20 or so PhDs ...
Some of them continued using this technique.
A person who contributed a lot was Professor Margarida de Mello Aires, who has the office next to mine.
She did her PhD with me when I first came back, and about two or three years later, she came to work with me.
She's been working with micropuncture and microperfusion since that time, since 1966, more or less.
In addition, there are many others.
I did some work with Marcelo Marcondes and with Antonino Reyes, with people from the Medical School.
Using micropuncture we studied the renal tubules of rats with kidney disease.
Lately, I've been working a lot with the pH, acid-base balance; in what way the kidney acidifies the urine, which is one of the very important functions of the kidney.
I went to the United States to work with transgenic mice in another area.
Today, this is done a lot; it's a very powerful technique.
Here it's more difficult; it's difficult for us to produce these mice here.
However, I went to the laboratory at Yale University, both in 2004 and at the end of last year, and we worked with mice that lack a transporter of ions, in this particular case, of potassium.
Another student, Nancy Rebouças, developed the molecular biology part after an internship at Yale, partly at my suggestion.
She's now one of the most important people in Sao Paulo working on molecular biology.
Another colleague, Antonio Carlos Cassola, is working on an electrophysiological technique, patch clamp, which also uses microelectrodes, which he learned in the same laboratory as Giebisch and one of his students, Y.
Wang.
Our whole group has developed from those beginnings.
In addition, collaborating with us is Adriana Girardi, a former PhD student of Nancy Rebouças, currently at the Heart Institute, who is working on both the heart and kidneys; she's another excellent molecular biologist.
We moved here in 1972.
We were given an area that was no larger than we had in the Medical School.
Now, we're reducing a little because, since I'm retiring and Margarida too, we have to cut down a little, until they decide to throw us out [laughs].
What's the focus of your project?
It's called ``Molecular and functional study of ion transporters in membranes.''
We're investigating how renal tubules transport sodium, potassium and hydrogen.
It's a continuation of what we've being doing over the years.
Nancy is working on the molecular biology part of the project.
Adriana herself, from InCor, and the people from our laboratory have been collaborating in this area; she's published works on molecular biology, especially with their help and a post-doctoral researcher from our lab, a former student of mine and of Nancy, Luciene Carraro-Lacroix, who is now doing post-doctoral studies in Canada.
At what stage is research in physiology in Brazil?
How have we evolved?
At the beginning of last century, physiology depended a lot on individual efforts.
In Rio, Professor Carlos Chagas began working at the Oswaldo Cruz Institute.
At that time, especially in Rio, college physiology was more teaching physiology, and scientific physiology was done in institutions like Manguinhos.
Here it was a little different.
The Medical School was established in 1913 and it immediately began, at least in part, to do research and teach at the same time.
In Rio, physiology research was done at the Carlos Chagas Institute of Biophysics, still today the most important research center in Rio, and here, most was done at the Medical School.
We have several people working in the different areas of physiology, such as cardiovascular, neurophysiology and now endocrinology.
The neurophysiology area is pretty good, especially after Professor Michael Covian, from Buenos Aires spent some time in Ribeirao Preto.
Here we had Professor Cesar Timo-Iaria, who was a student of Covian's, but both are now dead.
Professor Cesar came from Ribeirão Preto here and set up a neurophysiology group that is still very good.
Therefore, physiology grew progressively in several areas.
However, there are other good physiology groups in Brazil, especially in Ribeirão Preto, Belo Horizonte and Porto Alegre.
In Espirito Santo there's a good cardiology group, too.
There really has been fairly good growth.
Post-graduate education has helped a lot; it has attracted a lot of people to the area and improved its quality a lot.
Professor Covian came from Argentina in the 1950s; that country was a reference point in physiology.
Is it still?
At the time they already had a Nobel Prize winner, Bernardo Houssay.
There were very good biochemistry groups, like the one of the also winner of a Nobel Prize, Luis Leloir.
Today, it's difficult to say whether it's better or worse...
I think it tends to be worse rather than better.
With post-graduate studies physiology here has grown a lot.
As president of Fesbe, you were one of the leaders of the movement to remove the barriers on scientific experiments with animals.
Was this something important?
Yes, because we have powerful opponents, the animal protection societies, and they caused us a lot of difficulties.
In fact, in some places vivaria were invaded to release the animals.
Finally came the new law from Sergio Arouca, who died before seeing the bill passed, and it was very positive.
Now we need an ethics committee for animal experiments to be created in each unit, in each college.
This has already existed for humans.
Now they're starting with committees for animals, which is very positive, because it's clear that we have to treat our animals very well, give them suitable anesthesia and not let them suffer.
This is very important.
However, you can't stop using animals in science; that's also fundamental.
Up to a point there was a positive side to this pressure, in the sense of encouraging the search for alternative methods, wasn't there?
Yes, that of treating the animals appropriately.
We used to use dogs a lot.
They caught dogs in the streets and they were then used in research.
The Americans use dogs that are specially bred for this, more than we do.
But here it's difficult to do.
My PhD thesis on vitamin B1 was done with a dog.
Today we use rats more, because rats are bred specially for this, so it's more pleasant and a lot more controllable.
They don't seem to be so much like a pet as a dog or cat.
I remember that Dr. Alberto used a cat for his nutrition experiments, because cats are very good for studies when we need very homogeneous animals.
The size of a cat`s skull varies very little, unlike a dog.
The skull of cats is much the same among different individuals, and this greatly facilitates neurophysiology studies.
Now, cats are animals that are highly protected by society, so today they are hardly used any more.
And you can do a lot with a mouse as well.
Mice are used a lot today in molecular biology.
We did micropuncture with mice.
It's more difficult, it's a much smaller animal, but it's the most suitable for producing transgenic animals.
In an article you wrote for a book on higher education, you talk about merit within the university, how the university should change those who are not working and give access to younger researchers.
Does this issue worry you?
Up to a point.
Now, with post-graduate studies, this has diminished because to get into the Medical School or the ICB or some other good place people have to go do post-graduation and this generally improves the level of the people a lot.
However, not everyone who does post-graduate studies remains very productive.
There are people whose productivity falls after a few years.
And the question is what to do with these people.
They often go over to the administration side or teaching.
Or, now, they also go into industry.
This leads to a lot of in-fighting.
Theoretically, what really should happen is that career progression should depend on merit.
This has perhaps improved somewhat, because people used to teach more than they did research.
It's important that people know how to teach well.
However, the ideal thing is to both teach and do research, do both things.
In other countries there's not the stability of tenure in the career of the teacher-researcher we have here.
Maybe that's a good idea.
But I don't believe that happens because the class defense bodies are very strong.
These bodies are powerful.
We should have more advantages, including monetary ones, for those who produce more, as happens in the United States.
There, the situation is different because it is entities like FAPESP that pay a good part of their salary.
So the person who does not produce loses much of their salary and tends to change his or her life, in order to earn money doing something else.
Here we don't have this.
It's very comfortable.
You earn the same salary, which is not the worst there is, until the day you die.
But the funding system has developed ...
In almost all states we have foundations that support research, the FAPs.
The existence of these FAPs allowed teachers who produce to earn more money for research.
They're going to produce even more, because of this financial support from the FAPs and even from the CNPq [National Council for Scientific and Technological Development].
This is something positive and ends up by choosing the best to continue in the universities.
Even teachers with higher production can receive grants from the CNPq, and this is already an additional stimulus.
The Medical School has something good.
They help with the salary from the Medical School Foundation.
The staff who are supported end up earning more - and rightly so.
It's a way of supporting those who work more in the laboratory, because in medicine this is essential.
Those working full-time there wouldn't stay full-time if all they received was the basic salary we earn.
Getting back to your career, what are your plans for the future?
I'll keep on doing research while it's still possible.
I'm 76 years old and I don't know how long I can continue.
I'm in good health.
I've already had back surgery, the backbone was pinching the nerves in the legs and I managed to get over that well.
Obviously I cut down a little.
We always end up with less drive than we had in our youth; that's inevitable.
Even so I'm managing to do quite a lot.
The contact with young people, for example, is something that's stimulating.
At the moment, I only have one PhD student and an undergraduate scientific research student.
Young people prefer to stay with the younger ones too.
But we always end up getting someone else.
From the viewpoint of research, I'm still working on the excretion of potassium and with transgenic mice.
In fact, our ICB import sector has managed to import these mice.
However, I've also collaborated with colleagues in studies on tubular acidification from the point of view of the transport mechanism of H ions.
